Thank you!\u00a0 It's such an honor to be here tonight.\nI'm here as a proud American\u2026 a proud Democrat\u2026 a proud mother\u2026 and tonight in particular, a very, very proud daughter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarc and I almost can't believe it, but our daughter Charlotte is nearly two years old. She loves Elmo\u2026 she loves blueberries\u2026 and above all, she loves Facetiming with Grandma.\u00a0 My mom can be about to give a speech or walk on stage for a debate. It doesn't matter. She'll drop everything for a few minutes of blowing kisses and reading \"Chugga Chugga Choo Choo\" with her granddaughter.\nOur son Aidan is just five and a half weeks old. Thankfully, he's healthy and thriving \u2013 and well, we're biased, but we think he's just about the cutest baby in the world \u2013 a view I'm pretty sure my mom shares. \nAnd every day I spend as Charlotte and Aidan's mother, I think about my own mother \u2013 my wonderful, thoughtful, hilarious mother.\nMy earliest memory is my mom picking me up after I'd fallen down, giving me a big hug, and reading me Goodnight Moon. \nFrom that moment\u2026 to this one\u2026 every single memory I have of my mother is that \u2013 whatever else may be happening in her life \u2013 she's always, always there for me. \nEvery soccer and softball game. Every piano and dance recital. Sundays at our Methodist church and local library. Countless Saturdays spent finding shapes in the clouds. Making up stories about what we'd do if we ever met a triceratops \u2013 in my opinion, the friendliest dinosaur, though my mom would always remind me that, friendly or not, it's still a dinosaur. I was obsessed with dinosaurs. The day my parents took me to Dinosaur National Park, I didn't think life could get any better.\u00a0 \nWhenever my mother was away for work \u2013 which thankfully didn't happen very often \u2013 she left notes for me to open every day she was gone \u2013 all stacked neatly in a special drawer, each with a date on the front so I'd know which one to open on which day. When she went to France to learn about their childcare system, one was all about the Eiffel Tower. Another was about the ideas she hoped to bring home to help the kids of Arkansas. I treasured each and every one. They were another reminder that I was always in her thoughts and in her heart.\nGrowing up, conversations around our dinner table would start with what I learned in school that day.\u00a0 I remember one week talking every night about a book that had captured my imagination, \"A Wrinkle in Time.\" Only then would we talk about what my parents were working on \u2013 education, health care \u2013 whatever was consuming their days and keeping them up at night. I loved that my parents expected me to have opinions and be able to back them up with facts. I never once doubted that they cared about my thoughts and ideas. And I always, always knew how deeply they loved me.\u00a0 \nThat feeling \u2013 being valued and loved \u2013 that's something my mother wants for every child.\u00a0 It is the calling of her life.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMy parents raised me to know how lucky I was \u2013 to never have to worry about food on the table, good schools to go to, a safe neighborhood to play in. And they taught me to care about what happens in our world \u2013 and to do whatever I could to change what frustrated me and felt wrong.\u00a0 They taught me that's the responsibility that comes with being smiled on by fate. I know my kids are a bit young \u2013 but I'm already trying to instill those same values in them.\u00a0 \nThere's something else my mother taught me: public service is about service.\nAnd as her daughter, I've had a special window into how she serves.\u00a0 \nI've seen her holding the hands of mothers who are struggling to feed their kids or get them the health care they need \u2013 my mother promising to do everything she could to help.\nI've seen her right after those conversations, getting straight to work \u2013 figuring out what she could do, who she could call, how fast she could get results. She always feels like there isn't a moment to lose \u2013 because she knows that for that mom, for that family, there's not.\u00a0 \nAnd I've seen her at the low points \u2013 like the summer of 1994.\u00a0 Several people this week have mentioned her fight for universal health care. I saw it up close. It was bruising and exhausting.\u00a0 She fought her heart out\u2026 and she lost. For me, then 14 years old, it was pretty hard to watch. But my mom \u2013 she was amazing. She took a little time to replenish her spirits. Family movie nights definitely helped \u2013 Dad, as you heard, liked Police Academy\u2026 my mom and I loved Pride and Prejudice.\u00a0 And then, she got right back to work \u2013 because she thought she could still make a difference for kids. \nPeople ask me all the time how she does it.\u00a0 How she keeps going amid the sound and fury of politics.\nHere's how.\nIt's because she never forgets who she's fighting for.\nShe's worked to make it easier for foster kids to be adopted. For our 9/11 first responders to get the health care they deserve. For women around the world to be safe, to be treated with dignity, to have more opportunities. \nFights like these \u2013 they're what keep her going. They grab her heart and her conscience, and they never let go.\u00a0\u00a0 \nThat's who my mom is \u2013 a listener and a doer, a woman driven by compassion, by faith, by a fierce sense of justice and a heart full of love. \nSo this November, I'm voting for a woman who is my role model as a mother and as an advocate. A woman who has spent her whole life working for children and families.\u00a0 \nI'm voting for the progressive who will protect our planet from climate change and our communities from gun violence. Who will reform our criminal justice system\u2026 and who knows that women's rights are human rights \u2013 and LGBT rights are human rights \u2013 here at home and around the world.\u00a0\u00a0 \nI'm voting for a fighter who never, ever gives up\u2026 and who believes we can do better, when we come together and work together.\nI hope that one day my children will be as proud of me as I am of my mother. I'm so grateful to be her daughter. I'm so grateful that she's Charlotte and Aidan's grandmother. She makes me proud every single day.\nAnd Mom\u2026\nGrandma would be so, so proud of you tonight.\nTo everyone watching tonight, I know with all my heart that my mother will make us proud as our next President.\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis is the story of my mother, Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 \n[Biographical film]\nLadies and gentlemen:\u00a0 my mother\u2026 my hero\u2026 and our next President: Hillary Clinton.", "DR.

And by all of you -- and I mean this sincerely.\u00a0 Those of you who have been through this, you know I mean what I say, by all of you -- your love, your prayers, your support.\nBut you know what, we talk about -- we think about the countless thousands of other people who have suffered so much more than we have with so much less support, so much less reason to go on.\nBut they get up every morning, every day.\u00a0 They put one foot in front of the other.\u00a0 They keep going.\u00a0 That's the unbreakable spirit of the people of America.\u00a0 That's who we are. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0That's who we are.\u00a0 Don't forget it.\nLike the people in the neighborhoods that Jill and I grew up in -- she in Willow Grove, and my down in Wilmington and Claymont.\u00a0 The kid in Claymont with the most courage who always jumped in when you were double-teamed, or your back was against the wall, who became a cop because he always wanted to help people.\u00a0 The middle daughter of three daughters who always made her mother smile, who was a hero to her sisters, now a major in the United States Marines Corps, because, Mr. Vice President, I wanted to serve my country. \u00a0(Applause.)\nThe teacher -- the teachers who Jill knows and so many of you know who take money out of their own pockets to buy pencils and notebooks for the students who can't afford them. \u00a0(Applause.)\nWhy?\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because being a teacher is not what they do; it's who they are. \u00a0(Applause.)\nYou know what I know, for real.\u00a0 These are the people who are the heart and soul of this country.\u00a0 It's the America that I know, the America that Hillary knows and Tim Kaine knows. \u00a0\u00a0(Applause.)\nYou know, I've known Hillary for well over 30 years.\u00a0 Before she was First Lady of the United States, when she became First Lady.\u00a0 We served together in the United States Senate.\u00a0 And during her years as Secretary of State, once a week we had breakfast in my home, the Vice President's Residence.\nEverybody knows she's smart.\u00a0 Everybody knows she's tough.\u00a0 But I know what she's passionate about.\u00a0 I know Hillary. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0Hillary understands.\u00a0 Hillary gets it.\u00a0 Hillary understands that that college loan is about a lot more than getting a qualified student an education.\u00a0 It's about saving the mom and the dad from the indignity of having to look at their talented child and say, sonny, honey, I'm so sorry.\u00a0 The bank wouldn't lend me the money.\u00a0 I can't help you to get to school.\nI know that about Hillary.\u00a0 Hillary understood that for years millions of people went to bed staring at the ceiling, thinking, oh, my God, what if get breast cancer or he has a heart attack?\u00a0 I will lose everything.\u00a0 What will we do then?\nI know about Hillary Clinton. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0Ladies and gentlemen, we all understand what it will mean for our daughters and granddaughters when Hillary Clinton walks into the Oval Office as President of the United States of America. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0It will change their lives. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0My daughters and granddaughters can do anything any son or grandson can do.\u00a0 And she will prove it, Mr. Mayor.\nSo let me say as clearly as I can.\u00a0 If you live in the neighborhoods like the ones Jill and I grew up in, if you worry about your job and getting a decent pay, if you worry about your children's education, if you're taking care of an elderly parent, then there's only one -- only one person in this election who will help you.\u00a0 There's only one person in this race who will be there, who's always been there for you.\u00a0 And that's Hillary Clinton's life story. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0It's not just who she is.\u00a0 It's her life story. \u00a0She's always there.\u00a0 She's always been there. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0And so has Tim Kaine. \u00a0(Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, to state the obvious, and I'm not trying to be a wise guy here.\u00a0 I really mean it. \u00a0(Laughter.) \u00a0That's not Donald Trump's story.\u00a0 Just listen to me a second without booing or cheering.\u00a0 I mean this sincerely.\u00a0 We should really think about this.\u00a0 His cynicism is unbounded.\u00a0 His lack of empathy and compassion can be summed up in a phrase I suspect he's most proud of having made famous, you're fired.\nI mean really.\u00a0 I'm not joking.\u00a0 Think about that.\u00a0 Think about that.\u00a0 Think about everything you learned as a child -- no matter where you were raised.\u00a0 How can there be pleasure in saying, you're fired?\u00a0 He's trying to tell us he cares about the middle class. \u00a0Give me a break.\u00a0 That's a bunch of malarkey. \u00a0(Applause.)\nFolks, whatever -- whatever he thinks, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, I know I'm called Middle Class Joe.\u00a0 In Washington that's not meant as a compliment.\u00a0 It means you're not sophisticated.\u00a0 But I know why we're strong.\u00a0 I know why we have held together.\u00a0 I know why we are united.\u00a0 It's because there's always been a growing middle class.\u00a0 This guy doesn't have a clue about the middle class.\u00a0 Not a clue. \u00a0(Applause.)\nBecause, folks, when the middle class does well, the rich do very well, and the poor have hope.\u00a0 They have a way up.\u00a0 He has no clue about what makes America great.\u00a0 Actually he has no clue, period. \u00a0(Laughter and applause.)\nBut, folks, let me -- you got it.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: \u00a0Okay.\u00a0 But, folks, let me say something that has nothing to do with politics.\u00a0 Let me talk about something that I am deadly serious about. This is a complicated and uncertain world we live in.\u00a0 The threats are too great, the times are too uncertain to elect Donald Trump as President of the United States.\nNow let me finish.\u00a0 No major party nominee in the history of this nation has ever known less or has been less prepared to deal with our national security. \u00a0(Applause.)\nWe cannot elect a man who exploits our fears of ISIS and other terrorists, who has no plan whatsoever to make us safer; a man who embraces the tactics of our enemies -- torture, religious intolerance.\u00a0 You all know.\u00a0 All the Republicans know.\u00a0 That's not who we are.\u00a0 It betrays our values.\u00a0 It alienates those who we need in the fight against ISIS.\u00a0 Donald Trump with all his rhetoric would literally make us less safe.\nWe cannot elect a man who belittles our closest allies while embracing dictators like Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 No I mean it.\u00a0 A man who seeks to sow division in America for his own gain and disorder around the world; a man who confuses bluster with strength.\u00a0 We simply cannot let that happen as Americans.\u00a0 Period. \u00a0(Applause.)\nFolks, I have -- no one ever doubts I mean what I say.\u00a0 It's just that sometimes I say all that I mean. \u00a0(Laughter.) \u00a0But, folks, let me tell you what I literally tell every world leader I met with -- and I've met them all.\u00a0 It's never, never, never been a good bet to bet against America. \u00a0(Applause.)\nWe have the finest fighting force in the world. \u00a0(Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: \u00a0USA!\u00a0 USA!\u00a0 USA!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: \u00a0\u00a0Not only do we have the largest economy in the world, we have the strongest economy in the world.\u00a0 We have the most productive workers in the world.\u00a0 And given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down.\u00a0 Never!\u00a0 Never! \u00a0(Applause.)\nOrdinary people like us who do extraordinary things.\u00a0 We've had candidates before who attempted to get elected by appealing to our fears.\u00a0 But they have never succeeded.\u00a0 Because we do not scare easily.\u00a0 We never bow.\u00a0 We never bend.\u00a0 We never break when confronted with crisis.\u00a0 No!\u00a0 We endure.\u00a0 We overcome.\u00a0 And we always, always, always move forward. \u00a0(Applause.)\nThat's why I can say with absolute conviction: \u00a0I am more optimistic about our chances today than when I was elected as a 29-year-old kid to the Senate.\u00a0 The 21st Century is going to be the American Century. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0Because we lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.\nThat is the history of the journey of America.\u00a0 And God-willing, Hillary Clinton will write the next chapter in that journey.\nWe are America, second to none.\u00a0 And we own the finish line.\u00a0 Don't forget it. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0God bless you all and may God protect our troops.\u00a0 Come on!\u00a0 We're Americans!\u00a0 Thank you. \u00a0(Applause.)", "Robert Rodriguez:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm Robert Rodriguez.

I'm Brooks Bell, a technology entrepreneur in Raleigh, North Carolina. When I was 23 years old, I started my own company. It wasn't easy. Six months after launching, I had a stroke. I had to relearn to read, write, and talk. I was lucky. I recovered, and my fledgling company survived. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that wasn't my only struggle. In fact, it was one of my many ups and downs \u2014 familiar to any small business with big dreams. I've gained and lost big clients. I've had to let wonderful employees go. It's given me the scars that I know many entrepreneurs share.\nI believe in Hillary, because I know she also carries battle scars. Her relentless dedication to serve America over the past 30 years has been marked by hard choices \u2014 which makes this historic achievement all the more impressive. Her tenacity and toughness \u2014 her seasoned judgment \u2014 is exactly what we need in a president. We need someone ready for the hardest job on earth, day one. And that someone is Hillary Clinton!\nToday, my company employs 40 people. We partner with some of the largest organizations in America to help make the internet easier to use. We're growing quickly. My company is strong, as is my health, thanks in part to ongoing investment in education, health care, and innovation. Like they say, \"Thanks, Obama!\"\nHowever, I am worried \u2014 terrified \u2014 about what might happen if we elect Trump. I'm not just scared for my business, but for other young entrepreneurs like me. We've already seen the preview in my state of North Carolina. Earlier this year, our legislature passed what's known as the \"bathroom bill,\" which caused the New York Times to describe North Carolina as a \"pioneer in bigotry.\"\nBesides being deeply embarrassing and morally wrong, it had an immediate and dramatic effect on our state economy. I watched a large company cancel their expansion, taking 400 good jobs with them. Two influential technology investors immediately banned investments in our state. The NBA just pulled the All-Star Game out of town. The total economic cost is already $190 million and counting.\nWhat does this have to do with Trump? For starters, Trump selected Mike Pence as his running mate, the same Mike Pence who signed a discriminatory bill into Indiana law, with similar disastrous consequences. It's no surprise that The Economist has listed a Trump presidency as one of the top-ten risks to the world economy. \nFriends, I'm here tonight because the story of my startup is the story of America. Because how we write our next chapter is up to us. Please join me in standing up for an inclusive country, with innovation and entrepreneurship fueling our economic prosperity. \nLet's put Hillary Clinton where we need her most, as President of the United States of America.", "I'm here tonight not as a Democrat or a Republican.\nI'm here as a proud immigrant to this country, a proud veteran of the United States Army, and the proud recipient of our country's highest military honor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoldiers spend years training for one moment.

And as a former NASA astronaut who flew four missions to space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy decades as a pilot, military officer, and astronaut gave me a unique perspective.

I also saw the devastating human effects of war itself.\nFrom orbit, I saw our planet as a perfect blue marble. But I also saw shrinking glaciers and rainforests. At war and in space, I saw American leadership on display. But I was always frustrated to return to a country that struggles to address some of our biggest problems here at home.\nJust as Hillary is prepared to defend America, our values, and our freedom, Hillary is ready to take on one of our country's greatest moral failures here on our soil: the gun violence that is tearing so many of our communities apart. \nWe have to do better \u2014 and Hillary knows we can. Hillary knows that we save lives by doing more to keep guns out of the wrong hands. We know that as President she'll do the responsible thing: She'll stand up to the Washington gun lobby that works to protect the shameful status quo.\nSo if you want our legacy to be that we left our kids and grandkids a country with less gun violence \u2014 not more \u2014 then we need to make Hillary our President!\nNow, I want to introduce you to someone who is working every day to do just that.

They were brothers and sisters, sons and daughters. Above all, they were human beings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet while the nation mourned, Donald Trump strutted before the cameras, and exploited a national tragedy. He had the audacity to tell the American public he was the true champion for LGBTQ people in this race, and that our community would be better off with him in the White House. He even challenged his skeptics to\u00a0 \"ask the gays.\"\nWell, since he asked.\nWhile Donald Trump has threatened to strip away our rights, the Hillary Clinton I first got to know as a closeted kid growing up in Arkansas has always been willing to stand up for the voiceless, and she's made fighting for equality a cornerstone of her campaign.\nWhile Donald Trump has promised to legalize Kim Davis-style discrimination in all 50 states, Hillary Clinton has promised to sign the Equality Act into law. \nWhile Donald Trump chose as his running mate a governor who tried to divert HIV funding to finance the abusive practice of \"conversion therapy,\" Hillary Clinton is committed to stopping the spread of HIV, banning conversion therapy for minors, and ending the hate and violence our community still faces. \nAnd long before Donald Trump struggled to read the letters \"LGBTQ\" off a teleprompter, Hillary Clinton stood before the United Nations and boldly declared that gay rights are human rights.\nI want to remind Donald Trump of one thing. The LGBTQ community is as diverse as the fabric of our nation. We are Muslim. We are Jewish. We are women. We are black, white, and Latino. We are immigrants and we are people with disabilities. And when you attack one of us, you are attacking all of us.\nAnd that's why together, we are all with her.", "When I was Philadelphia Police Commissioner, we mourned eight officers killed in the line of duty. After the attacks on police in Dallas and Baton Rouge, an entire nation mourned eight more. After 47 years in law enforcement \u2013 in Chicago, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia \u2013 I've mourned far too many officers killed by guns. And as a nation, we've mourned far too many people who have fallen victim to gun violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm here to say we need more than grieving. To protect our law enforcement and to serve those heroes who have fallen, we need commonsense measures to reduce gun violence. Police need these commonsense measures. And a leader who will fight for them.\nI grew up in the Englewood neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago. The haze of gun violence hangs heavy there. My brother's best friend was murdered 50 feet from our house. He had refused to join a gang. A few years later, a Chicago police officer was shot dead in almost the same spot. He had been filling out a report in his patrol car.\nGun violence isn't unique to Englewood. It continues to visit neighborhoods across the U.S. During my years in policing, I've seen the crime scenes. I've seen the grieving families. I've seen the costs of gun violence. Now more than ever, we need a strong\u00a0and steady\u00a0leader to stop the bloodshed, protect our officers from being outgunned by weapons of war, and rebuild the bonds between police and communities. That's why I'm with Hillary Clinton.\nHillary Clinton is the strong leader to protect our cops and communities from gun violence.\u00a0She has stood with our first responders when we needed her most. In the days after September 11th. In making sure they got the benefits they had earned. And today,\u00a0she supports comprehensive background checks and the assault weapons ban. Those who aim to do harm shouldn't get a handgun, let alone an assault rifle.\nHillary Clinton is the steady leader to shepherd us through this critical time.\u00a0The bonds between law enforcement and communities are frayed. We can't play to America's worst fears. We need to champion our greatest hopes.\nHillary will. She'll bring police and communities closer together. She'll support those who feel forgotten in challenged areas like the South Side of Chicago, Southeast DC, and North Philadelphia. And she'll support dedicated police officers working to improve their communities. Important as ever, Hillary Clinton will build bridges between communities and cops. That's better than building walls.\nHillary Clinton is the right person to become the 45th President of the United States of America. She will work to strengthen bonds of trust between police and the communities they serve.

It took just minutes, but I know it gave me power for a lifetime. The power to make my voice heard and to shape the future of our country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a Millennial \u2013 a member of the largest generation of Americans since the Baby Boom. But nearly four out of five young people stayed home in the 2014 Congressional election. \nImagine what can happen if we all make our voices heard at the ballot box this November. \nWe can elect a president who will fight to give every American a chance to graduate from college debt-free.\nWe can elect a president who will fight for equal pay for equal work. My amazing mother became a single parent when I was 13 years old. It wasn't easy. She had to balance a job and caring for her family. Imagine the difference equal pay could make for today's working moms and their families.\nSo listen: If you still haven't yet registered to vote, get registered right away. Check out www.iwillvote.com for more information about your state's deadlines and confirm you're registered. Don't miss this chance to make your voice count.

We can make Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States.", "Like generations of Americans, I've always dreamed about making that proud walk across a graduation stage to get my college diploma. \nIn 2005, that dream came true at Grand Valley State University, which prepared me to do what I love \u2013 teach back home in North Carolina. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen came the bill. $40,000 in student debt, and all the anxiety and struggle that comes with it. \nTeaching offers so many rewards. A big salary isn't one of them. \nThe $300 check I write every month represents savings I can't put away, car repairs I can't make, medical costs I have to put off.\u00a0 \nAnd with my wife, Amanda, in school after taking time off to help care for her sick mother, another $30,000 bill is on the way. \nLife feels like we're running on a treadmill. No matter how hard we try, we can't get ahead. \nI'm not alone. Student debt has more than doubled in the last decade and now exceeds $1.2 trillion. \nNone of us are looking for guaranteed success \u2013 just a fair chance at it. That's why I'm so proud to support Hillary Clinton. \nShe's going to make college debt-free for all and help millions of people like me, with existing debt, save thousands of dollars. \nI don't know her. But, it feels like she knows me. \nHillary Clinton has our backs. \nLet's have hers in November.", "Donald Trump: Basta! Abajo! \nLike Hillary Clinton, I've spent my life fighting for human rights \u2014 for workers, for women, for immigrants, for the LGBT community, for every person who needs a voice. And with Donald Trump on the ballot, we can't be quiet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe insults Latinos like we're second-class citizens \u2014 like we're visitors to this country. But I've got news for him: We've been here all along. We helped build and continue to build this country. \nMy great-grandfather, Marshall St. John, fought in the Civil War on the Union side. My father, Juan Fern\u00e1ndez, was a farmer, an accountant, an assemblyman, and served in World War II like C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez. My mother, Alicia St. John, was a businesswoman. \nEight hundred thousand Latinos turn 18 every year and their contributions will sustain Medicare and Social Security for our seniors. We aren't a footnote in the American story. We're helping write it! And we're going to take our Latino power and use it this November. Our votes will increase paychecks. Our votes will get immigration reform. Our votes will ensure reproductive rights for women. \nWe have to be active Democrats. Every Democrat is a potential activist. Every moment is an organizing moment. Every minute is a chance to get voters ready, to educate them, to knock on doors, and make sure they get involved. Election day is the most important day in our life. \nI've known and worked with Hillary for 25 years. And this is why I trust her. During my lifetime, Hillary and the Democratic Party have always stood up for Latinos. \nWith an experienced and visionary leader like Hillary in the driver's seat \u2014 and Tim Kaine as the copilot \u2014 she will lead us on the journey for justice and equality. \nBut she can't do it alone. We are the energy. We are the wheels. And she can't go forward without us. \nDonald Trump needs to get out of the way. And if he doesn't, we're going to move him out of the way. \nWe will show Donald Trump and his friends who's got the power. \nWho's got the power?\nWho's got the power?\nWhat kind of power? \nVoting power. \nNow let's use it this November. \nAbajo Trump!\nS\u00ed\u00a0Se Puede.", "It's an honor to be here; candidly, it's also a shock.\nNot because of the momentous nature of this event, or the size of the crowd. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a shock because, unlike many of you, I'm a Republican. \nForty years ago, I cast my first vote for president, voting Republican that day like I would do time and again. \nI haven't just voted Republican, I worked in President Reagan's White House. I recently led an effort to place a statue of Ronald Reagan in California's Capitol. \nI'm here tonight to say: I knew Ronald Reagan; I worked for Ronald Reagan. Donald Trump, you are no Ronald Reagan. \nPresident Reagan famously said, \"Tear down this wall.\" Trump says, \"Build the wall,\" \u2014 because that will \"Make America Great Again.\"\nReagan saw nuance. Trump sees the world as us vs. them, where somebody with brown skin or a foreign-sounding name is likely to blame for our troubles.\nReagan knew that a leader needs diplomacy to steer a safe, prosperous course forward. Trump is a petulant, dangerously unbalanced reality star who will coddle tyrants and alienate allies.\nI shudder to think where he might lead our great nation. Fortunately, I don't believe he'll get that chance.\nWhile Hillary holds many policy positions that differ from my own, her qualifications are indisputable. \nHillary knows that our strength as a nation lies in uniting, not dividing.\nThis year's Republican platform is the most alarming I've ever seen. It's laced with anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-women positions that do not represent the views of most Americans.\nThat is why this year, I will vote for a Democrat for the first time. \nTo my fellow Republicans: If you, like I do, believe loyalty to our country is more important than loyalty to party; if you want a President with a good judgment, a steady hand, and the temperament to represent our Nation to the world \u2013 and our children; I ask you to join me in voting for Hillary Clinton as President of the United States.", "Thank you.

It has been an honor.\nAnd let me thank you for the love and support you have given our family. It has meant the world to us.\nOver the past eight years, America has gotten to know the Joe Biden that I know and love.\nHe's honest and strong; principled and compassionate.\nHe was authentic long before it became a buzzword in politics.\nHe understands that working people are the backbone of this nation.\nAnd he has tremendous empathy for those in need. \nHe knows \u2013 as I do \u2013 that education is the great equalizer and that community colleges are America's best-kept secret.\nAnd he believes \u2013 as do I \u2013 that we have a special obligation to our military and their families. \nHe has a deep commitment to justice and he has spent his whole career standing up to the abuse of power.\nHe knows, at its best, politics is always a matter of the heart.\nAnd he remains today \u2013 even after all he's been through \u2013 the most optimistic person I know.\nHe loves his family.

So I'm here. \nI'm here for the mothers and daughters who are planning weddings, so that you get to watch your daughter walk down the aisle.\nI'm here for those lives cut short, in a school, or a movie theater, in a church, at work, in their neighborhoods or homes \u2014 because those voices should never be silenced.\nI am here alone \u2014 without my mother \u2014 while too many politicians cower behind the gun lobby instead of standing with American families.\nWe don't need another Charleston, or San Bernardino, or Dallas, or countless other acts of everyday gun violence that don't make the headlines.\u00a0\nWe don't need our teachers or principals going to work in fear.\u00a0\nWhat we need is another mother who is\u00a0willing to do what is right \u2014 whose bravery can live up in equal measure to my mom's.\nWe need to elect Hillary Clinton as the 45th President of the United States of America so that no other daughter ever has to say: I would give every day I have left for just one more day with my mom.", "Good evening.\nMy son's last words were, \"We mean you no harm.\" Tywanza. My hero. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo days later, I forgave the shooter who murdered him. Hate destroys those who harbor it, and I refused to let hate destroy me.\nStill, I have to ask: How was he able to purchase the gun he used to kill so many? After that fateful day, Hillary Clinton called on lawmakers to close the Charleston loophole. Because of that loophole, even though the shooter had an arrest record, when it didn't surface and three days had passed, he could still buy that gun.\nNo one should see what I've seen, suffer how we've suffered. \nThe Bible tells us that if we humble ourselves, pray, and \"turn from our wicked ways,\" God will forgive us and heal our land. \nLet us heed God's word, and in turn, may God heal our nation. \nMedia Contact:press@demconvention.com215-398-5252\nLogo - https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160420/357779LOGO \n\u00a0\nSOURCE  2016 Democratic National Convention Committee\n Related Links\n\nhttps://www.demconvention.com", "The question was simple. Megan Andrade, a student at the University of New Hampshire, asked Donald Trump about his plan to fight climate change. Trump mocked her, like he's mocked so many others. But climate change is no joke. From floods in Miami, to droughts in California, to forest fires in Colorado, and rising sea levels in Virginia, it's clear. Climate change is here, and it's having a devastating impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm Gene Karpinski, President of the League of Conservation Voters. Our very top priority this year is electing Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States! \nThe stakes could not be higher. \nClimate change is happening now. Yet Donald Trump calls it \u2014 \u00a0and I quote \u2014 \"a hoax!\" \nAnd more than just deny it, his policies would make climate change worse. His energy \"plan\" would mean more pollution in our air, more poison in our water, and more public lands stripped for private profit. That may be good for the Koch brothers and Big Oil. But Trump's policies would be terrible for our families or our future. \nThat's why today we're naming Donald Trump to our Dirty Dozen list \u2014 I can't imagine anyone more deserving!\nAnd it's why we must elect Hillary Clinton our next President. \nWe proudly endorsed Hillary last November: the earliest in our history. Why? Hillary is a proven leader with a vision and plan to combat climate change and to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\nHer solutions are win-win-win-win \u2014 good for our economy, our security, our health, and our planet. \nAnd she's not just a leader on climate change and clean energy. She called attention to the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and has ambitious plans to rebuild our aging infrastructure and fight for environmental justice. \nSo this November, the question is simple. \nAre we going to protect polluter profits? Or protect public health?\nAre we going to go backward on our policy successes? Or continue forward?\nAre we going to elect a climate denier? Or a climate champion?\nWe're Stronger Together!

They went there and risked their lives because they love this country. They are here before you because this is the most consequential race for the Presidency in memory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stakes are enormous. We must not, we could not stand on the sidelines. This election can carry us to a future of unity and hope, or to a dark place of discord and fear. We must choose hope.\nEvery American, in uniform or out, in the White House or at home, must be a force for unity in America, for a vision that includes all of us: every man and woman, every race, every ethnicity, every faith and creed, every gender orientation \u2013 all of us together pursuing our common values. \nFrom the battlefield to the capitals of our allies, friends, and partners, the free peoples of the world look to America as the last best hope for peace and for liberty for all humanity, for we ARE the greatest country on this planet.\nSo we stand before you tonight to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States of America. \nWe trust her judgment. We believe in her vision for a united America and we believe in her vision of America as the just and strong leader against the forces of hatred, chaos, and darkness. We know that she \u2013 as no other \u2013 knows how to use all instruments of American power, not just the military, to keep us all SAFE and FREE.\nI tell you without any hesitation or reservation that Hillary Clinton will be EXACTLY the kind of Commander-in-Chief America needs today. I know this because I served with her. I know this as the former Special Envoy to the Global Coalition against ISIS. \nWith her as our Commander-in-Chief, America will continue to lead in this volatile world. We will oppose and resist tyranny as we defeat evil. America will defeat ISIS and protect the homeland. America will honor our treaty obligations. We will lead and strengthen NATO, the Atlantic Alliance, and our allies in East Asia and around the world whom we have solemnly sworn to defend. America will stop the spread of nuclear weapons and keep them from dangerous states and groups. Our armed forces will be stronger. They will have the finest weapons and equipment. They will have the support of the American people, and the American military will continue to be THE shining example of America at our very best. Our veterans will be thanked by a grateful nation, and they will be cared for in the manner they deserve for the sacrifices they have made for all of us, for this great country, and for world peace.\nBut I also know that with her as our Commander-in-Chief, our international relations will NOT be reduced to a business transaction. Our armed forces will NOT become an instrument of torture, and they will NOT be ordered to engage in murder or carry out other illegal activities.\nWith Hillary Clinton as our Commander-in-Chief, the United States will continue to be that indispensable, transformational power in the world. \nTo our allies and our friends and our partners: We are with you. America will not abandon you. To those acting against peace, civilization, and the world order: We will oppose you. And to our enemies: We will pursue you as ONLY America can. You will fear us.

Freedom and equality, justice and opportunity.\nWe should be so proud that these words are associated with us. That when people hear them \u2013 they hear America.\nSo don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak.\nWe're not.\nDon't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes.\nWe do.\nAnd most of all, don't believe anyone who says: \"I alone can fix it.\"\nThose were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland.\nAnd they should set off alarm bells for all of us.\nReally?\nI alone can fix it?\nIsn't he forgetting?\nTroops on the front lines.\nPolice officers and fire fighters who run toward danger.\nDoctors and nurses who care for us.\nTeachers who change lives.\nEntrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem.\nMothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe.\nHe's forgetting every last one of us.\nAmericans don't say: \"I alone can fix it.\"\nWe say: \"We'll fix it together.\"\nRemember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power.\nTwo hundred and forty years later, we still put our faith in each other.\u00a0\nLook at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers.\nChief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them.\nAnd you know how the community responded?\nNearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.\nThat's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.\nTwenty years ago I wrote a book called \"It Takes a Village.\" A lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck do you mean by that?\nThis is what I mean.\nNone of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.\u00a0 \u00a0\nAmerica needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger.\nI believe that with all my heart.\nThat's why \"Stronger Together\" is not just a lesson from our history.\nIt's not just a slogan for our campaign.\nIt's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build.\nA country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nWhere you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in.\nA country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach.\nWhere families are strong, communities are safe, and yes, love trumps hate.\nThat's the country we're fighting for.\nThat's the future we're working toward, and so it is with humility, determination. and boundless confidence in America's promise that I accept your nomination for President of the United States!\nNow, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage.\nAs you know, I'm not one of those people.\nI've been your First Lady. Served 8 years as a Senator from the great State of New York.\nI ran for President and lost.\nThen I represented all of you as Secretary of State.\nBut my job titles only tell you what I've done.\nThey don't tell you why.\nThe truth is, through all these years of public service, the \"service\" part has always come easier to me than the \"public\" part.\nI get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.\nSo let me tell you.\nThe family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings.\nMy family were builders of a different kind.\nBuilders in the way most American families are.\nThey used whatever tools they had \u2013 whatever God gave them \u2013 and whatever life in America provided \u2013 and built better lives and better futures for their kids.\nMy grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years.\nBecause he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did.\nAnd he was right.\nMy dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor.\nWhen the war was over he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.\nI remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens.\nHe wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had.\nAnd he did. My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, working as a house maid.\nShe was saved by the kindness of others.\nHer first grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought extra food to share.\nThe lesson she passed on to me years later stuck with me:\nNo one gets through life alone.\nWe have to look out for each other and lift each other up.\nShe made sure I learned the words of our Methodist faith:\n\"Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.\"\nI went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school.\nI remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house.\nShe told me how badly she wanted to go to school \u2013 it just didn't seem possible.\nAnd I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she went through as a child.\nIt became clear to me that simply caring is not enough.\nTo drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws.\nYou need both understanding and action.\nSo we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.\nIt's a big idea, isn't it?\nEvery kid with a disability has the right to go to school.\nBut how do you make an idea like that real? You do it step-by-step, year-by-year, sometimes even door-by-door.\nAnd my heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza on this stage, representing millions of young people who \u2013 because of those changes to our laws \u2013 are able to get an education.\nIt's true, I sweat the details of policy \u2013 whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs.\nBecause it's not just a detail if it's your kid - if it's your family.\nIt's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.\nOver the last three days, you've seen some of the people who've inspired me.\nPeople who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine. \u00a0\nPeople like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning.\nThey told their stories Tuesday night.\nI first met Ryan as a seven-year old.\nHe was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed forty pounds.\nChildren like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed, and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids every year.\nLauren was gravely injured on 9/11.\nIt was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero.\nI was still thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others ten years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.\nIn this campaign, I've met so many people who motivate me to keep fighting for change.\nAnd, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.\nI will be a President for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.\nFor the struggling, the striving and the successful.\nFor those who vote for me and those who don't.\nFor all Americans.\nTonight, we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for President.\nStanding here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come.\nHappy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.\nHappy for boys and men, too \u2013 because when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit.\nSo let's keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves.\nBecause even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead.\nLet's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.\nNow, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.\nOur economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. That's real progress.\nBut none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.\nWe're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.\nI've gone around our country talking to working families. And I've heard from so many of you who feel like the economy just isn't working.\nSome of you are frustrated \u2013 even furious.\nAnd you know what? You're right.\nIt's not yet working the way it should.\nAmericans are willing to work \u2013 and work hard.\nBut right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do.\nAnd less respect for them, period.\nDemocrats are the party of working people.\nBut we haven't done a good enough job showing that we get what you're going through, and that we're going to do something about it.\nSo I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives.\nMy primary mission as President will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States, from my first day in office to my last!\nEspecially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind.\nFrom our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. \u00a0\nFrom communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures.\nAnd here's what I believe.\nI believe America thrives when the middle class thrives.\nI believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.\nThat's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them. And we'll pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United!\nI believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return.\nMany of them are. But too many aren't.\nIt's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.\nAnd I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again.\nI believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.\nI believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to kick them out.\nComprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together - and it's the right thing to do.\u00a0\nWhatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.\nIf you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us.\nIf you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty -- join us.\nIf you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care\u2026 join us.\nIf you believe that we should say \"no\" to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers, join us.\nIf you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own heath care decisions, join us.\nAnd yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay\u2026 join us.\nLet's make sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nNow, you didn't hear any of this from Donald Trump at his convention.\nHe spoke for 70-odd minutes \u2013 and I do mean odd.\nAnd he offered zero solutions. But we already know he doesn't believe these things.\nNo wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans.\nYou might have noticed, I love talking about mine.\nIn my first 100 days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.\nJobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure.\nIf we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future.\nAnd we will transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.\nBernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all!\nWe will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.\nIt's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, but students and families can't refinance theirs.\nAnd here's something we don't say often enough: College is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.\nWe're going to help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.\nWe're going to give small businesses a boost. Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks.\nIn America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.\nWe're going to help you balance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the \"woman card,\" then Deal Me In!\n(Oh, you've heard that one?)\nNow, here's the thing, we're not only going to make all these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them.\nAnd here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.\nNot because we resent success. Because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is.\nAnd if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back. And we'll put that money to work where it belongs \u2014 creating jobs here at home!\nNow I know some of you are sitting at home thinking, well that all sounds pretty good.\nBut how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington? Look at my record. I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that's what I'll do as President.\nBut Trump, he's a businessman. He must know something about the economy.\nWell, let's take a closer look.\nIn Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you'll find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.\nPeople who did the work and needed the money, and didn't get it \u2013 not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them.\nThat sales pitch he's making to be your president? Put your faith in him \u2013 and you'll win big? That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag.\nHe also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado.\nTrump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.\nDonald Trump says he wants to make America great again \u2013 well, he could start by actually making things in America again.\nThe choice we face is just as stark when it comes to our national security.\nAnyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face.\nFrom Baghdad and Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, to San Bernardino and Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.\nNo wonder people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership.\nYou want a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do it will be my highest priority.\nI'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot \u2013 now we have to enforce it, and keep supporting Israel's security.\nI'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement \u2013 now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.\nI'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.\nI've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS.\nWe will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen.\nWe will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.\nIt won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake \u2013 we will prevail. \u00a0\nNow Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do\u2026.\"\nNo, Donald, you don't.\nHe thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are \"a disaster.\"\nWell, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a Senator on the Armed Services Committee.\nI know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure.\nWe entrust our commander-in-chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces.\nDecisions about war and peace. Life and death.\nA president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country \u2013 including the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.\nAsk yourself: Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief?\nDonald Trump can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign.\nHe loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally.\nImagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\nI can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started \u2013 not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men \u2013 the ones moved by fear and pride.\nAmerica's strength doesn't come from lashing out.\nStrength relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power.\nThat's the kind of Commander-in-Chief I pledge to be.\nAnd if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a President who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.\nI'm not here to repeal the 2nd Amendment.\nI'm not here to take away your guns.\nI just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.\nWe should be working with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm. \u00a0\nFor decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics were too hot to touch.\nBut I ask you: how can we just stand by and do nothing?\nYou heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence.\nYou heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.\nI refuse to believe we can't find common ground here.\nWe have to heal the divides in our country.\nNot just on guns. But on race. Immigration. \u00a0And more.\nThat starts with listening to each other. Hearing each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other's shoes.\nSo let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable.\nLet's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job.\nWe will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end, and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\nWe will defend all our rights \u2013 civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities!\nAnd we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from.\nFor the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments \u2013 excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.\nThey think he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says \u2013 like when he called women \"pigs.\" Or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability.\nOr insults prisoners of war like John McCain \u2013a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect.\nAt first, I admit, I couldn't believe he meant it either. \u00a0\nIt was just too hard to fathom \u2013 that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that.\nBut here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump.This is it.\nAnd in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great \u2013 because America is good.\nSo enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change.\nHe's offering empty promises. What are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country - to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.\nThe choice is clear.\nEvery generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer, and stronger.\u00a0\nNone of us can do it alone.\u00a0\nI know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together again.\nBut I'm here to tell you tonight \u2013 progress is possible.\nI know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.\nAnd I know it from my own life. More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game.\nLike so much else, I got this from my mother. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. \"Go back out there,\" she said.\nAnd she was right. You have to stand up to bullies.\u00a0 You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\nWe lost my mother a few years ago. I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what.\nThat's what we need to do together as a nation.\nThough \"we may not live to see the glory,\" as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, \"let us gladly join the fight.\"\nLet our legacy be about \"planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.\"\nThat's why we're here, not just in this hall, but on this Earth.\nThe Founders showed us that.\nAnd so have many others since.\nThey were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.\nThat is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight.\nYes, the world is watching what we do.\nYes, America's destiny is ours to choose.\nSo let's be stronger together.\nLooking to the future with courage and confidence.\nBuilding a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country.\nWhen we do, America will be greater than ever.\nThank you and may God bless the United States of America!", "Almighty and gracious God, God of unlimited love and uncompromising faithfulness:\nAt this auspicious day and hour, we call upon Your great and holy name, and we ask that You come to us and abide in us, illuminating our minds and souls with the light of Your truth and Your goodness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have revealed Yourself as the defender of the poor and the guide of the blind, as the protector of orphans and the liberator of the oppressed, as the friend of the foreigner and the consolation of the outcast. Open our hearts to become more like You, O compassionate One. Teach us to walk in Your gracious and generous ways.\nBless our nation today, O Lord, even as You blessed us so richly in years past. Grant us stability and security, justice and freedom, righteousness and peace. Appoint for us leaders and legislators and judges who will guide us to fulfill Your holy will and to build a better world for all people.\nSend Your mercies upon these, Your servants, the delegates of the Democratic National Convention. Bestow grace on those they have nominated for the exalted and awesome offices of President and Vice President of the United States of America \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tim Kaine \u2014 so that they may be faithful in their calling, and may honorably serve You, and our fellow citizens, and all the peoples of the world, through their conduct in the days and months and years ahead. \nWe embrace Your holy words, Lord, believing that \"righteousness exalts a nation\" (Proverbs 14:34). Holy God: Exalt and lift high these United States of America, to follow in Your righteousness, Your mercy, Your compassion, Your unconditional love, and to walk in Your truth that sets us free, and will keep us free.\nAnd so we pray reiterating the words of the Bible, \"Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God unto the ages of ages! Amen\" (Revelation 7:12).", "I am a 4th generation Texan. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas women are tough. We approach challenges with clear eyes and full hearts. To succeed in life, all we need are the tools, the trust, and the chance to chart our own path. I was fortunate enough to have these things when I found out I was pregnant years ago. I wanted a family, but it was the wrong time. I made the decision that was best for me \u2013 to have an abortion \u2013 and was able to get compassionate care at a clinic in my own community. Now, years later, my husband and I are parents to two incredible children.\nMy story is not unique. About one in three American women have abortions by the age of 45, and the majority are mothers just trying to take care of the families they already have. You see, it's not as simple as bad girls get abortions and good girls have families. We are the same women at different times in our lives \u2013 each making decisions that are the best for us.\nIf we want families to succeed, we start by empowering women. Give us accurate information and access to health care. Keep politicians out of our business when we're not ready to parent, and support us when we are. That's what gives our families the best chance to get ahead and stay ahead. And that is what Hillary Clinton has spent decades fighting for.\nDonald Trump is different. He said women who have abortions should be punished. He calls women \"pigs\" and says breastfeeding is \"disgusting.\" \nNow some people think he doesn't really mean any of that. But, look who he picked for VP. \nMike Pence led the charge to defund Planned Parenthood, pushed to let hospitals turn a woman away if she needs an abortion to save her life, and signed a bill with some of the most outrageous abortion restrictions in the country. He has even said he can't wait to send Roe v. Wade \"into the ash heap of history.\" Together, Donald Trump and Mike Pence have united to form the \"make misogyny great again\" ticket.\nAnd the people who so loudly oppose abortion rights? Let me let you in on their dirty little secret: They're not only against abortions. Many of these people are also fighting to restrict access to contraception and block commonsense policies to support working moms. \nIt's not abortion that bothers them. It's empowering women to live our own lives. When we have power over our own destiny, we not only strengthen our families, we honor our most cherished traditions of liberty and equality.\nThese aren't just \"women's issues\" \u2013 these are the very foundation of our freedom.\nWe need a president who has the experience, the wisdom, and the grit to stand up against the bullies. We need a president who knows that \"women's rights are human rights.\" We need a president who will keep expanding the frontiers of freedom for all Americans.\nWe need Hillary Clinton.", "As a billionaire preaches nostalgia for the past, it's worth remembering our past. \nIn 1948, a 10-year-old girl in Orangeburg, South Carolina, had to drag bags of cotton. That girl was my grandmother. Millions of other Americans lived separate, unequal lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1960, a college student was arrested in Orangeburg for protesting that unjust system \u2014 and in jail, met his future wife. That student was Jim Clyburn.\nThanks to him and countless other marchers, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Johnson correctly predicted Democrats would lose the South for a generation as a result.\nBut to paraphrase JFK, now the torch has been passed to a new generation of southerners \u2014 diverse, progressive, and fed-up with Republicans' failed governance and dangerous divisiveness.\nWhen this generation hears Trump claim that America was only great in some bygone era, we know painfully well we can't go back to the old America and the Old South. \nDemocrats believe in a New South because no matter your race, immigration status, income, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity, we all have the same aspirations for high-quality education, jobs, neighborhoods, health care, and retirement. \nThese aspirations were my grandmother's, who now sees her grandson as the first black party chair in South Carolina. \nThese aspirations were Jim Clyburn's, who became Majority Whip of the U.S. House of Representatives. \nOnly Democrats can help all Americans fulfill these aspirations.\nAfter the horrific massacre at Emanuel AME Church, South Carolinians united to take down the Confederate flag.\nBut we can't pat ourselves on the back for taking down the flag until we take down the barriers to education and health care. We can't pat ourselves on the back for being polite until we do right.\nHillary Clinton, who followed her heart to Arkansas, understands that the American Dream extends beyond the Mason-Dixon line and that South Carolina's motto, \"While I breathe, I hope,\" applies to all. She is strongly supporting all of our state parties with a 50-state strategy because we are Stronger Together, and only together will we more truly become one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.", "I will never forget the moment I heard that Patrick's helicopter did not return. In an instant, the life I knew was destroyed. The partner I loved, gone. My daughter's father, taken away, forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've never felt more scared or alone than I did then. I wondered what Christmas and birthdays would look like. But half a country away, a United States Senator was looking out for me \u2014 and countless others like me. Her name was Hillary Clinton. You see, before Hillary took office, the families of fallen soldiers received $12,000. And yet, when you need to bury your best friend, when you need to raise a child on your own, when you need to rebuild your life from rubble, $12,000 doesn't go very far.\nHillary understood, so she did something about it. Without fuss or fanfare, she worked across party lines. She led the Congress to increase survivor benefits to $100,000. And it made all the difference in the world.\nLooking back on it, I didn't even realize who was responsible. And when I did learn about Hillary's work, I didn't see her as a Democrat or a Republican. I simply saw a fighter for people like us, for families like mine. She stood up for the principle that a family's personal tragedy must not be a financial tragedy as well. \nToday, my daughter Brisa is finishing high school. I'm completing my degree in emergency crisis management, committed to serving my country in the best way that I can. And our family is making it \u2014 step by step, day by day.\nHillary Clinton has fought for families like mine, each and every day of her career. This is a woman who I have never met \u2014 whose life could not be more different from my own \u2014 but who has stood with my family and me, over and over again.\nHillary has always been with me \u2014 in bad times and in worse. And that's why I'm with Her.", "One of my first memories is standing outside our Richmond, Virginia polling place with my dad to hand out campaign literature in support of our chosen candidates, our chosen Republican candidates. \nWhen it comes to campaigning, I have done it all: phone banked voters and knocked on so many doors. I bet a lot of you did the same. One difference though: I campaigned exclusively for the GOP\u2026until this election.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've voted Republican my entire life. I believe in the bedrock values of the Republican Party: liberty, equality, and the idea that there are individual rights that cannot be taken away. These are values to be proud of. \nAnd because the Republican party has abandoned those values this year, this Republican is voting for Hillary Clinton.\nIn Donald Trump's America, it doesn't matter that I'm an accomplished attorney and a policy expert, it just matters how attractive I am on a scale of one to ten. \nTrump's loathsome comments about women and our appearances are too many to list and too crass to repeat. But they are too important to ignore. \nTrump can discount our accomplishments, he can disrespect our abilities, but come November he can't disregard our votes! \nThere are some who will say I'm supporting Hillary Clinton because she's a woman. People who say that dismiss my voice and Hillary's long record of public service. \nAnd there are some who I know are contemplating staying home this November. Your voice can help define the next chapter of American values, American policy, and American leadership around the world \u2013 for better, or for worse. \nI'm here tonight to ask my fellow Republicans and America's Independents to join me to not only OPPOSE Donald Trump, but to SUPPORT Hillary Clinton. \nBecause we're not just Republicans and Democrats, we're Americans. \nThank you.", "Jake: I was so happy after I got hired last month at Pizza Studio that I immediately shared the news on SnapChat. My friend Jensen messaged me and told me she got hired there, too. We were excited that we'd be working together. Then we started talking and figured out that I would be making $8.25 an hour, but Jensen was only offered $8. We are the same age. We were hired for the same job on the same day. And as far as we could tell, we both had the same knowledge of pizza. So we didn't understand why we wouldn't be paid the same amount. \nJensen: I thought it was a mistake, so I called our new boss to ask. Instead of fixing it, she fired me and Jake for talking about our wages. And she never answered my question about why I was going to be paid less. Then our story started getting out. We couldn't believe it when Hillary Clinton tweeted her support for me and shared our story. I may have lost my job, but I'm proud that I spoke up for myself, and I'm glad that Jake stood with me. And we're both glad that Hillary Clinton stood with us.\nJake: Our story isn't just about fighting for equal pay. It's about doing the right thing and having each other's back. Because if we don't do that, nothing will change. \nJensen: It doesn't matter how old you are. We all need to be brave enough to speak up for ourselves and stand up for each other.

Where fear abounds, hope must abound even more.\"\u00a0In this stormy season of violent campaign rhetoric, we are called to be steady in the face of the whirlwind. There's a tug of war going on for the soul of America. We have a clear choice.

She's fought for access to health care all of her life. In Hillary we have a tested, tried and trusted partner. No one has ever been more prepared to be president.\nHillary can be trusted to appoint a fair Supreme Court and a skilled administration, including a man of faith like Sen. Tim Kaine. She will fight to make us more secure by banning assault weapons that are turning our communities into killing fields. She can be trusted to honor the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party.\nHillary understands the historic dimensions of the agony, hope, and promise of Black Lives Matter. From Trayvon Martin to Michael Brown and Alton Sterling, and far too many others, shootings of young black men must stop. And the killing of police officers with powerful assault weapons resonates deep in our soul. We must choose reconciliation over retaliation and revenge. We must stop the killing. Now.\nWe can trust Hillary not to insult our Hispanic and Muslim brothers and sisters. And to resist the mass deportation of 15 million people. We can trust Hillary to expand African trade and development. We can trust Hillary to fight for Historically Black Colleges and Universities \u2013 that graduate 42 percent of our black engineers and over half of all black teachers and lawyers. A Clinton Administration will grow jobs. Eight years ago, Republicans drove our economy to the brink of disaster. But after 76 straight months of job growth under President Obama, it's no time to turn back now.\nWe've never lost a battle we fought. And we've never won a battle unless we fought. In 1965, we fought and won the battle for the historic Voting Rights Act. That journey continued in 1984 and 1988, when we built a winning coalition, registering and empowering millions of new voters reflecting the new America.\nMy words in 1984 ring true today:\nIf blacks register and vote in great numbers, progressive whites win. It's the only way progressive whites win.\u00a0If blacks vote in great numbers, Hispanics win. When blacks, Hispanics, and progressive whites vote, women win. When women win, children win. When women and children win, workers win. We must all come up together. We must come up together. When we all come together, we can and will win. Red, yellow, brown, and white, we are all precious in God's sight.\nIt's healing time.\u00a0It's hope time.\u00a0It's Hillary time.\u00a0It's time for healing, hope, and Hillary.\u00a0Healing, hope, and Hillary!\nKeep Hope Alive!", "Captain Humayun Khan is one of 14 American Muslim soldiers who have died serving the United States since 9/11.

As we close out the final hours of this great convention, I am reminded of the first American saint, Philadelphia's own Katherine Drexel, who believed that joy derives from serving and loving our neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a man proud of my Catholic faith and a proud resident of Philadelphia, I am honored to introduce our next speakers.\nThey are leaders in the faith community who share these values and work to serve their communities. Through their faith, they bring hope and joy to others.\nIt is with deep respect that I now welcome Archbishop Demetrios, Rev. Bernice King, and Gov. Eddie Torres to each lead us in an invocation.", "At the age of 24, I deployed to Iraq. We regularly received indirect fire. After an attack, everything would fall silent. Seconds later, I would hear the sounds of the Army artillery battery returning fire, and the quick reaction force helicopters taking off in the enemy's direction. \nAs a young Marine Corps lieutenant in a non-combat position, these two units, along with the special operations teams and Marine infantry battalions stationed with us, were our first line of defense. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI trusted them with my life. \nI trusted that my commanders had the right strategy. \nI trusted that we were abiding by the rules of engagement\u2014even when our enemy chose not to. \nThat trust starts at the top of the chain of command. \nAnd I trust Hillary Clinton to be Commander-in-Chief. She understands the importance of a strong military and diplomacy. She knows we're stronger when we work with our allies to keep us safe, and she has a specific plan to defeat and destroy ISIS. She has the experience, temperament, and steady hand to lead. \nI don't trust Donald Trump. \nThe military is defined by discipline. Leadership. Integrity. Those are the qualities that drew me to serve. And those are the very qualities that Donald Trump lacks. \nHe suggests abandoning our closest allies. He praises dictators who've killed Americans. He says we should allow more countries to get nuclear weapons. \nHis recklessness means more deployments for my friends, more families separated, and more young heroes never coming home. \nWhen he says he would expand torture, kill civilians, or force the military to commit war crimes, he's defying the values that every service member is taught. He's defying the values we risk our lives to defend. \nThis election isn't just about Donald Trump's judgment\u2014it's about ours. Our troops, our nation, our world can't afford for us to get this wrong.", "I'm here because the next president of these United States invited me. At first I wondered if Hillary really knew who I was. Not just my work in entertainment, but who I really am? Does she know my sister's under house arrest? Does she know my brother, Maynard, is in jail? That my father was a police officer, shot and murdered right here in Philadelphia, when I was 15? Does she even know I've been to jail?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's the America that I know. And still I rise. And then it hit me like a brick. Hillary knows me. And that's what gave me the courage to speak to you tonight.\nHillary has stood with\u00a0families of people who died due to gun violence. She's helped turn their heartache into action. I wish there was a Hillary around for me when I lost my dad. Hillary understands our right to bear arms but wants to keep guns from getting into the wrong hands.\nThirty-three thousand Americans die each year from gun violence. That's 90 people a day. Enough. We need to take action now. And there is only one candidate willing to take on the gun lobby and keep our families safe.\nAnd for that millennial who comes from where I come from and doesn't think they have a voice \u2014 you do. There is no other choice. This is the most important election of our lifetime. Come November, vote for her. \nAnd may God bless you, Hillary Clinton, and please,\u00a0God, bless America.", "Good evening, my name is Lorella Praeli, and I am an American. As you saw in the video, I recently became a U.S. Citizen, but for 14 years I was undocumented. At the age of 2, I was hit by a car and lost my leg. When I think about our American story, I believe it was born in the hearts of my parents that night as they stood over my hospital bed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause my parents were determined that I would reach my full potential and not be limited by my disability. And eventually, the only place that could contain such a vision was here in America. Because this is a country that was made for people with the courage to believe in their dreams.\nBack in Peru, my mother, Chela, was a psychologist. But here in America, she's worked cleaning houses for the last 17 years, from morning to night, carrying the American spirit in her heart. She, like so many millions of parents across this country, worked so that my sister and I could have a full life. She has taught me to never give up, to believe in my dreams, and to fight to achieve them. In short, it was my undocumented mother that taught me what it is to be an American.\nThat's why I'm fighting for Hillary Clinton. Because she never gives up. Because she believes in our dreams, and because she will fight to achieve them.\nEntonces, amigos, nuestra voz est\u00e1 en nuestro voto.\u00a0As\u00ed que, si queremos hacer historia este noviembre, si queremos que nos oigan, tomen sus tel\u00e9fonos ahora mismo y texteen DREAM, D \u2013 R \u2013 E \u2013 A - M al 47246.

Win every day. \nThat's the motto of our organizing program on the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm an organizer at heart and organize every day on behalf of my mother. For 35 years, she taught 4th and 5th grade at an under-resourced public school in my hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. She used her own money to buy pencils, paper, and other items 'cause she believed that all kids deserved an education regardless of the zip code they lived in.\nLike my mother, Hillary Clinton has fought for kids for over 30 years. Hillary also believes in organizing, because she knows we are Stronger Together. That's why on July 18, we announced a campaign-wide push to register and commit 3 million people to vote during the campaign.\n3 Million Stronger is about taking action in our communities, bringing many voters into this process, including the voices of young voters, and organizing in all 50 states across the country for Democrats up and down the ticket.\nIn fact, we have some great organizing happening around the country right now:\nDenver, COHosting our watch party in Denver, Colorado tonight is the Reverend Lucia Guzman, minority leader of the Colorado State Senate.\nMadison, WIOur crew in Madison, Wisconsin is at the famous Old Fashioned bar downtown. Their host is Brendan Cohen, who works with his local College Democrats chapter.\nNew York, NYWe've got people gathered in Midtown Manhattan, our host there is Francesca Hogi, who grew up in the Bronx and was one of our best volunteers during the New York primary.\nRichmond, VAOur last group is in Richmond, Virginia, home of the next Vice President of the United States, Tim Kaine. Our host there is 12-year-old Elijah Coles-Brown.\nAfter today, the folks you just met will go out into their neighborhoods and register or commit people to vote and participate in 3 Million Stronger.

That's a lot of life.\u00a0How would I describe her? Loves to laugh, especially at herself; world class listener; quick to forgive; sensitive; empathetic. But, like her mother, Dorothy, if she gets knocked down seven times, she will get up eight.\u00a0\nOne night in Arkansas, many years ago, a group of us went back to their place for dessert. \nWe were sitting on the kitchen counters, and Bill and Hillary were talking in deep nuance about health care for children.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs they were talking, I remember looking at Bill and thinking, \"I wish you could become President someday.\" \nThen I looked at Hillary and thought, \"Wouldn't it say something to our daughters, our sons, to all those people whose lives I know you could touch if you became President? Because I know you. I know you will never stop working your heart out for them!\" \nThat was 38 years ago. Then, it seemed like too much to dream for.

The shooter in Orlando had hate in his heart. And the shooter in Dallas did too.\nSo much hate. Too much. But, as Scripture says, \"Love never fails.\" \nSo, I choose love. And, in this election, I choose Hillary Clinton. \nHillary was in South Carolina the day before the shooting. And in the days that followed, she talked about the hatred in our nation, the racism, the injustice. She said that we can't hide from these truths. She called on us to \"name them and own them and then change them.\" \nTogether, we can fight for that change. Together, we can heal. Together, we can love. \nThank you.", "Good evening. My name is John Hutson, and unlike Donald Trump, there are two things I know an awful lot about: law and order. For 11 years, I was a law school dean. And for 30 years, I served proudly in the United States Navy, including as Judge Advocate General.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump calls himself the \"law-and-order candidate,\" but he'll violate international law. In his words, he endorses torture \"at a minimum.\" He'll order our troops to commit war crimes like killing civilians. And he actually said, \"You have to take out their families.\" And what did he say when he was told that's illegal? He said our troops \"won't refuse, believe me.\" This morning, he personally invited Russia to hack us! That's not law and order. That's criminal intent!\nDonald Trump would abandon our allies and let more countries get nuclear weapons. He lies about donating to our veterans and called the military I served in a \"disaster.\" It's embarrassing enough that he's the face of one of our political parties. The real disaster is what would happen if we let Donald Trump become the face of the country we love.\nMore than 120 Republican national-security leaders recently warned that Donald Trump would, in their words, \"make America less safe.\" He even mocks our POWs, like John McCain. I served in the same Navy as John McCain. I used to vote in the same party as John McCain. Donald, you're not fit to polish John McCain's boots!\nBut America, we have a better choice. Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who knows how to work with our allies and who has a specific plan to defeat ISIS. She is smart and steady. She has the experience, temperament, and spine to be a superb Commander-in-Chief. She knows what makes us the envy of the world. It's not our abundant natural resources, our resilient economy, or even that we have the strongest military on earth. Our strength comes from who we are, our humanity. If we lose our humanity, we lose the battle and the war.\nISIS and other radical Islamic groups have no humanity. That is their weakness. Our enemy can't defeat us militarily. Victory won't be found on the battlefield. For them, victory is to make us more like them: people who torture, who destabilize the international order, who target innocents because they don't look like them or don't pray like them. Donald Trump is a walking, talking recruiting poster for terrorists. That's not hyperbole. ISIS literally used Trump in a commercial.\nYou know, you can tell a lot about a person by whom they admire. Eleanor Roosevelt, Nelson Mandela, Dorothy Rodham \u2013 these are Hillary Clinton's heroes. Donald Trump admires Donald Trump and Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong-un. And of Vladimir Putin, he said, and I quote, \"in terms of leadership he's getting an 'A.'\"\nI taught national security law. Praising dictators is an automatic \"F\" in my class. In the 2008 election, as the dean of the University of New Hampshire School of Law School, I invited each presidential candidate to talk about terrorism with me and other retired admirals and generals. Of all the candidates we met with, Hillary Clinton was by far the best prepared and most knowledgeable. She listened carefully and tested our arguments. We had more than 500 years of collective experience, and we learned from her. This was before she served as our Secretary of State. Before she brokered a cease-fire in Gaza, rallied the world to sanction Iran, advised President Obama to take out bin Laden, and restored our reputation in the world.\nAnyone who's served with the young men and women of our armed forces knows how serious it is to send them into harm's way. When you're a soldier, sailor, airman, or marine, you don't get to choose your commanders. But when you're a citizen \u2013 you have the responsibility to choose the Commander-in-Chief who will keep us safe, strong, and secure. Choose Hillary.", "Majestic and magnificent God, creator of us all. \nYou have created from one blood all nations to dwell upon the face of the Earth.

As we walk into the autumn of elections we pray You would guide our great nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLord, help us transcend the nefarious traps of cynicism, despair, and division with the courageous work of hope and love. Teach us to continuously cherish and fervently defend the dignity of all our sisters and brothers. Help us never to tire in the work of compassion and justice. Instruct us to be ever-mindful of the most vulnerable among us; the child, the widow, the orphan, and the immigrant. Dios, danos la valentia de confrontar nuestros desaf\u00edos con amor. Help us to hew the future of our Republic from the bedrock of love. May our work reflect Your character of compassion, justice, and civility. May we never be satisfied until every child of God has an opportunity to flourish.\nFrom Portland to Philadelphia, from our small towns to our magnificent cities, from our police officers to our children, help us to move forward in unity; a more perfect union that believes that despair and violence can never triumph over love, hope, and justice. Lord, help us to do this work together - rich and poor, from every ethnicity and color, women and men, the elderly and the young. We confess that we are our brother's and sister's keeper and that together we can do more. Give us optimistic tenacity to respond to some of the day's persistent chasms with hope. Help us to never cease until our nation sees the day when we transform any jangling discords in our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood and sisterhood. \nThis I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.", "My name is Sarah McBride, and I am a transgender American. Four years ago, I came out as transgender while serving as student body president in college. At the time, I was scared. I worried that my dreams and my identity were mutually exclusive. \nSince then, I have seen that change is possible. I witnessed history while interning in the White House and helping my home state of Delaware pass protections for transgender people. Today, I see this change in the work of the LGBT Caucus and in my own job at the Human Rights Campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut despite our progress, so much work remains. Will we be a nation where there's only one way to love, one way to look, one way to live? Or, will we be a nation where everyone has the freedom to live openly and equally; a nation that's Stronger Together? That's the question in this election.\nFor me, this struggle for equality became all the more urgent when I learned that my future husband, Andrew, was battling cancer. I met Andy, who was a transgender man, fighting for equality and we fell in love. And even in the face of his terminal illness \u2014 this 28 year-old \u2014 he never wavered in his commitment to our cause and his belief that this country can change. We married in 2014, and just five days after our wedding, he passed away. \nKnowing Andy left me profoundly changed. More than anything, his passing taught me that every day matters when it comes to building a world where every person can live their life to the fullest. \nHillary Clinton understands the urgency of our fight. She will work with us to pass the Equality Act, to combat violence against transgender women of color, and to end the HIV and AIDS epidemic once and for all. \nToday in America, LGBTQ people are targeted by hate that lives in both laws and hearts. Many still struggle just to get by. But I believe tomorrow can be different. Tomorrow, we can be respected and protected \u2014 especially if Hillary Clinton is our president. And that's why I'm proud to say that I'm with Her.", "You're probably wondering: Who the heck is this sweet little old lady?\nI am Sharon Belkofer \u2013 a mom to three boys who served our country, a retired nurse and a wife of 52 years, a grandma of 10, and even a great-grandma now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that President Obama has meant so much to millions of Americans across the country. I'd like to tell you what he means to me.\nSix years ago, on the morning of May 18, 2010, I became a Gold Star Mom \u2013 we became a Gold Star Family \u2013 when my son Tom, a lieutenant colonel, was killed in Afghanistan.\u00a0\nI first met the President shortly after at Fort Drum, where he was scheduled to speak to the 10th Mountain Division, but when he heard Gold Star Families were there, he wanted to meet with us. And as he was hugging me, I cried all over his suit. Tom would have been so\u00a0embarrassed.\nBut it must have been OK, because a year later, at an event in my home state of Ohio, as I hoped to get a picture signed, someone told me, \"The President would like to see you.\" Well, that's when I got my second presidential hug. So warm and kind, so compassionate.\nI was inspired.\nMaybe this sweet old lady could still make a difference.\nI knew my community's schools needed more resources, so at age 73, I took a leap of faith and ran for my local school board. And when my back was bothering me and I didn't feel like knocking on doors, when the wind was blowing and it was cold and dreary, I thought of my son, Tom, who never gave up. And I thought of our President.\nHe never gives up. So why should I be different? Besides, they tell me walking is good for your back.\nWell, guess what \u2013 I won my election. I won big! The President even sent me a handwritten note of congratulations. That's who he is \u2013 no matter how busy, he's never forgotten this little old lady in Ohio who has always had his back.\nYou see, some people in this world make big differences. My son, Tom, made big differences. The President continues to make big differences \u2013 and smaller ones too. Like the inspiration he poured into me \u2013 so that I might make a difference of my own.\nI wish every American could hug President Obama \u2013 so that they could see the good in his eyes and feel the warmth in his heart.\nThis is our President.", "I'm here tonight because of my passionate commitment to our amazing democracy, as an American deeply concerned about my family's future, indeed, our nation's shared future. And, I'm particularly concerned about the climate crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, when we talk about greenhouse gases and warming temperatures, deadlier droughts, and more devastating storms, we're not talking just about the weather, but how the weather affects the economy and, thus, our people. They're the people you'll see in a few moments, people affected by climate change right here in America, right now. They are us.\nA rancher in Texas losing his herd because the cows have no grass to eat. A farmer in Kansas whose crops are dying because there's no rain. A mom in New York who lost her young daughter in a flood made worse by rising sea levels.\nCan Donald Trump look these people in the eye and say climate change is, \"a hoax?\" That there's nothing we can do? This is a moment when we, as a nation, have to decide whether we'll ignore the truth and allow real people to continue to suffer, or whether we will put aside our differences, and come together to do what's right. \nHillary Clinton gets it. She cares. She's committed. She understands that taking a stand against climate change is not about politics. It's about our moral obligation to one another, to our children, and to the generations that will one day inherit this earth.", "\"I will fight for you,\" she said, \"no matter how long it takes.\" I have known Hillary Rodham Clinton for over two decades now.\nAnd years ago, when she visited us on \"The View,\" I told her, \"When you decide that you're ready to be the first woman President of the United States, I'll be there to help.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, here I am! But most importantly, here we all are. And we are all with her, because she has always been with us!\nAs a former prosecutor, I like to deal in facts. Here's a fact: \"There has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than Hillary, ever.\" \nPresident Barack Obama said that.\nHere's another fact: Nobody else in the race has the same unique connection to women, children, families, and our day-to-day challenges. \nI'm saying that.\nAnd that's very different from some very loud, obnoxious, race-baiting folk on the other side, who I also know\u2026 \nShade.\nBoy, bye.\nNowhere do we need a president who cares about all Americans more than in the place we're about to visit: Flint, Michigan.", "One hundred years ago this November, a social worker from my home state of Montana, Jeanette Rankin, became the first woman ever elected to Congress. The first, but not the last. Once that barrier fell, there was no turning back.\nAnd, for over 31 years, EMILY's List has helped elect hundreds more women to the House, and the Senate, and every other office on the ballot. Except one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton may be our first woman president. But she won't be the last. Once that barrier falls, it will never, ever, ever be put back up. The women we've elected haven't just brought new voices to the debate. They've brought new momentum to the progressive movement. You see, women don't just fight for women. They fight for families. They fight for fairness. Inclusion. Justice.\nNo wonder Republican leaders oppose equal pay for women, and refuse to stand up for working mothers trying to balance career and family. That's why they'd let your boss fire you for using birth control, and force us to undergo invasive trans-vaginal ultrasounds. They don't respect women. They don't trust women. They want to control women.\nThey're afraid of the change we bring, the progress we make, when we get a chance to lead. And they're terrified of Hillary Clinton. Because no matter what they throw at her, they've never been able to stop her. From the Children's Defense Fund to the Senate, from Little Rock to Beijing, she's fought for fairness, for inclusion, for justice, and she's won.\nNow, they're making their last stand. Not just against her, but against all of us who have worked so hard for so long to make progress in America. They're panicking. They're desperate. And that means they're dangerous. They've nominated a man who said women should be punished for having an abortion. Said, \"Putting a wife to work is a dangerous thing.\" Called us \"fat pigs\" and \"animals.\" \nHe picked a running mate who led the fight to destroy Planned Parenthood, tried to redefine rape, suggested that mothers who work \"stunt the emotional growth\" of their kids by putting them in daycare. If they win, they'll erase every ounce of progress we've dared to make. But we have fought too hard and come too far to let that happen. \nLet's stand together to elect more Democratic women up and down the ballot. More women in local office. More women in the House. More women in the Senate \u2014 enough to take back the majority!

Standing with me are my fellow Asian-American and Pacific Islander \u2013 or AAPI \u2013 Members of Congress. Many of them, too, are trailblazers in their own right. And we are all proud to support Hillary Clinton for President of the United States! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that if you saw an Asian Pacific American walking in the U.S. Capitol, you had to stop and do a double-take. But how things have changed. We now have a record number of AAPI Members of Congress \u2013 and most importantly, we are organizing and making our voices heard. We have gone from being marginalized to becoming the margin of victory in key swing states and districts all across our nation. \nAmerica needs a president who will fight for all of us \u2013 someone who rejects the hateful rhetoric that is too often used to divide us and believes that America's diversity is our greatest strength. That's why we've got to elect Hillary Clinton as our next President of the United States! When it comes to the issues most important to us, Hillary Clinton gets it. \nOn immigration reform, she gets it. So many families have been kept apart for decades by an incredibly long family visa backlog. Hillary will fight to clear that backlog so that millions of American families can finally be reunited with their loved ones. We're with Hillary because she is committed to comprehensive immigration reform! \nOn education, she gets it. So many of our parents and grandparents sacrificed to come to the United States because they wanted their children to get a better education and live the American Dream. We're with Hillary because she'll make debt-free college available for all Americans.\nOn voting rights, she gets it. Today, almost 70 percent of AAPI adults are foreign born. Access to translated and absentee ballots is critical. We're with Hillary because she will work with Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act and ensure fair access to the ballot box.\nOn making sure we have a diverse federal government, she gets it. We're with Hillary because she will appoint an administration that looks like America. \nAnd on safeguarding our civil liberties, she gets it. I am proud to have Congresswoman Doris Matsui and Congressman Mike Honda as members of our caucus. During World War II, both Doris and Mike were imprisoned in internment camps for no other reason than their ethnicity. Donald Trump doesn't seem to see a problem with this part of our history. With Hillary Clinton, we know the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans will be protected! \nTonight, we are also grieving for our dear friend and colleague, Congressman Mark Takai from Hawai'i, who passed away last week at the age of 49 after a hard-fought battle with pancreatic cancer. Mark truly had the aloha spirit, and was deeply committed to advancing the priorities of the people of Hawai'i and our veterans. I will never forget the tears in his eyes when he learned about the Cancer Moonshot initiative. It gave him and millions of Americans hope that we will finally find a cure for cancer. In his memory, we've got to keep hoping \u2013 and fighting. \nHillary Clinton is the best choice for all Americans to move our country forward. Our caucus members reflect the diversity of America. And that is why we are proud to stand with her.\nSen. Mazie Hirono: \nI am Senator Mazie Hirono from Hawai'i, an immigrant and the first Asian-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate.

I am Congresswoman Bordallo from Guam, and I support Hillary Clinton because she understands the unique needs of the territories, and is committed to the Asia-Pacific rebalance. She is the strong leader we need to move forward as a nation.\nRep. Mark Takano: \nI am Congressman Mark Takano from California, the first openly gay person of color elected to Congress. As a proud \"gaysian,\" I support Hillary Clinton because she is a strong champion for LGBT rights. She will to fight to end employment discrimination against LGBT Americans. \nRep. Ami Bera: \nI am Congressman Ami Bera from California. As the only South Asian member of Congress, and as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I support Hillary Clinton because she is the only candidate that understands the complexity of the world and is prepared from day one to lead America.\nRep. Bobby Scott: \nI'm Congressman Bobby Scott from Virginia, the first Filipino-American voting member of Congress, and I support Hillary Clinton because she believes that each and every child deserves a quality, affordable education so that they can reach their full potential.\nRep. Ted Lieu: \u00a0\u00a0\nI am Congressman Ted Lieu from California and a colonel in the U.S. Air Force reserve. I support Hillary Clinton because she'll fight for our military personnel, veterans, and families. She will make sure that those who risked their lives for our country get the health care and the resources that they need. \nRep. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan:\nI am Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan from the Northern Mariana Islands. I support Hillary Clinton because she believes that all Americans \u2013 including those in the Pacific Island territories \u2013 should have access to quality, affordable health care. \u00a0\nRep. Grace Meng:\nI am Congresswoman Grace Meng from New York, the first Asian-American elected to Congress from the East Coast, and I support Hillary Clinton because she is the best candidate to bring Americans together and move our country forward! This election is so important, and Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders can make the difference. Our voting power has doubled over the last decade \u2013 we are now the swing vote in swing states like Virginia, Nevada, and also right here in Pennsylvania! And I call upon my fellow AAPIs to organize, to campaign, and to vote, so that we will be the margin of victory in 2016 and beyond! As our community continues to grow \u2013 and as we begin to see more AAPI candidates like Raja Krishnamoorthi from Illinois and Stephanie Murphy from Florida begin to run for higher office \u2013 it is critical that we elect a person who will make history for America and build a brighter future for generations to come. And that person is Hillary Clinton!", "Chairman Rep. G.K. Butterfield:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellow Democrats, I'm Congressman G.K. Butterfield from North Carolina. In my community, you judge a man's heart by his words and deeds. \nDonald J. Trump, your words have been hostile, bigoted, and insulting. You have used every opportunity to talk about your wealth; to denigrate people who don't hold your views, even within your own party. You are not qualified to serve as president. Instead of putting forth details to address income inequality and opportunity for everyday Americans, you use your celebrity status to paint a picture of gloom and doom. You use your status to alienate African-Americans and other groups. And you would use the Office of President to take our great Nation in the wrong direction. \nYou want to know why your polling numbers are so dismal among African-Americans? I will tell you. We know you have gotten rich through your business. But we also know your wealth has come at the expense of other people. We know you have no plan to address issues directly affecting African-American communities such as gun violence, voting rights, preserving Historically Black Colleges and Universities, raising the minimum wage, and addressing persistent poverty.\nDemocrats want a better future for all of our people, all of our families. Read our platform and compare it to the Republican platform. Give us this chance by electing Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine to lead our great country. \nRep. Andr\u00e9 Carson:\nMy name is Andr\u00e9 Carson. I stand here today not just as a representative of Indiana, but as a young African-American Muslim and former cop.\nOver the last year, millions of loyal, good-hearted Muslims and African-Americans like me have watched the deep-seated hatred of the past once again become mainstream. Together, we have been singled out in the national spotlight as threats to be dealt with \u2013 not part of our American family. If Donald Trump and Mike Pence have their way, this slide into hatred and bigotry will only get worse.\nI'm from Indiana and have seen Mike Pence's terrible judgment up close. Pence has fought against same-sex couples having equal rights. Pence rejected federal funding for pre-K education. And for years, Pence has fought to defund Planned Parenthood, both in Indiana and nationally.\nWe cannot let this terrible judgment impact our civil rights.\nThat's why we need Hillary Clinton. She believes that if every uniform makes you fear profiling and suspicion, if you watch your kids leave in the morning and wonder if they'll come home at night, you deserve compassion and understanding.\nHillary Clinton is undaunted by the challenges that have plagued our communities for too long. She stands with us, and we need to stand with her.\nRep. Karen Bass:\nFellow Democrats, my name is Karen Bass.\nTogether, we have 103 days to show the nation that there is a better path for our country than the one Donald Trump offers. One-hundred and three days to ensure our nation will NOT slide backwards to the bigotry of our past. One-hundred and three days to stop our country from giving in to the incoherent rage which Trump has taken advantage of to declare war on common sense. \nDonald Trump, when you take pride in your outright ignorance of world affairs, when you promise the mass deportation of Latino families, when you dismiss officer-involved shootings of African-Americans, when you degrade women, you unite us. Because we are Democrats, and we embrace the full diversity of the American rainbow. Look around, you Democrats. The diversity in this room reflects ALL of America. Not part of America, like last week's Republican Convention. \nMy fellow Democrats, I challenge you to take all of Donald Trump's hateful energy and turn it into the fuel we need to take back the House. To take back the Senate. And to make Madam Secretary, Madam President Hillary Clinton.\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries:\nI'm Hakeem Jeffries. I stand here today on the shoulder of giants like Shirley Chisolm, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., Barbara Jordan, Charles Rangel, and so many others who have made it possible for a kid from Brooklyn to serve in the United States Congress.\nThis November, America faces a clear choice between the most qualified nominee ever to seek the presidency and the least qualified nominee ever to seek the presidency. It's choice between a Commander-in-Chief and a Bankrupter-in-Chief. It's a choice between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Hate. Donald Trump is a bounced check, but Hillary Clinton is money in the bank.\nShe believes that America is better off today because of the Presidency of Barack Obama.\nShe believes we must provide for the poor, work for working families, make sense for the middle class, and stand up for senior citizens. She believes we must innovate in the inner-city, strengthen suburban communities, and revitalize rural America. She believes we must increase economic opportunity, end the mass incarceration era, and eradicate police brutality.\nShe believes that whether you're black, white, Latino, Asian, Muslim, Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, gay, straight, young, or old \u2013 everyone deserves equal protection under the law, and that's why she'll be the next President of the United States.\nRep. Yvette Clarke:\nMy fellow Democrats, envision an America where you can graduate from college without crushing debt. Where American manufacturing jobs are on the rise again, women are paid equally, and seniors live with dignity and comfort, thanks to a strong Social Security system. Where we stand united with the conviction that we can make our great country even greater, by lifting each other up, not tearing each other apart.\nWe cannot get there with a Serial Divider, a bottomless vessel of egotism who exploits our fault lines to advance his favorite cause: himself. We can get there with Hillary, a leader with experience and statesmanship, who's lived a life of public service to advance the noblest cause: our great nation.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am CongressWOMAN Yvette Clarke from Brooklyn, New York. My mother, the Honorable Una Clarke, is the first Caribbean-born American woman elected to the New York City Council and my Congressional district was once represented by the first African-Caribbean American Congresswoman, Shirley Chisholm.\nI know a great leader when I see HER. Hillary Rodham Clinton is our great leader, and our next President of the United States!\nRep. Gregory Meeks:\nI'm Congressman Gregory Meeks, and I'm honored to unite around our nominee and my good friend, Hillary Rodham Clinton. As a lifelong New Yorker, I've seen the two presidential candidates up close. Let me tell you, Hillary offers everything that Donald Trump cannot. \nShe fights for American workers. He refuses to pay them.\nShe plans to make college debt-free for all. He creates a sham university to exploit others. \nShe offers unity and forward-thinking. He offers division and plans that take us backwards. \nDonald says, \"I'm always right.\" But the truth is he's wrong. He's wrong for our families, he's wrong for our communities, and he's wrong for our country. \nHillary Clinton cares about the aspirations of all Americans. She's going to tackle income inequality, provide opportunities for the poor, and strengthen the middle class. And she's going to invest in communities that have been neglected for far too long. \nLet's band together and work together. Let's aspire for more and challenge ourselves to be better. Let's build a strong future for our kids and our country by sending Hillary Clinton to the White House this November.", "As ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware of the grave threats we face \u2014 from the murderous brutality of ISIS and al-Qaeda to Iran's sponsorship of terror; from the belligerence of Vladimir Putin to the madman in Pyongyang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis November, America's decision is about more than who confronts these threats, it's also about how. Will we continue to be a beacon for freedom loving peoples around the world?\u00a0Or will we hunker down, shelter in place, or worse, sow division and discord? Will we pick a man with no vision, who cowers behind angry rhetoric? Or will we pick a woman of courage, conviction and compassion?\nIn short, the stakes could not be higher. \nWhen the rights of expression, religion and association are under growing assault around the globe, when the world needs a leader who can offer \"blood, tears, toil and sweat,\" Trump offers only bluster, tirade, swindle, and threat. \nWith malice towards all, and charity for none, Trump would separate us from the world, and divide us here at home. In Trump's world, NATO is a relic, Putin an ally, Tiananmen an example, and torture our instrument.\u00a0This is not leadership; this is calamity.\nIt is not speaking hard truths or shunning political correctness \u2014 but, instead, failing to see America's greatness, its essential goodness, its unending promise. Like an easy mark at one of his casinos, Trump would have us throw the dice with America's future. We will not do it.\u00a0\nBut thank God, America has a choice. Rather than a man of endless ego and obsession, we can choose a woman of purpose and determination. Instead of a man who sees little but danger and murder in the face of immigrants, we can choose a woman who understands how immigrants have strengthened this nation of immigrants.\nInstead of a man who would gamble on the greatness of America, we can choose a woman with a brilliant mind, a resolute heart, a steady hand, and a passion for the betterment of humankind.\nDemocrats: this fall, the choice for Commander-in-Chief is clear \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton!", "Hello, my fellow Democrats\u00a0and\u00a0my friends\u00a0from the great state\u00a0of Florida!\u00a0\nAs I prepared for tonight, I thought back on the path that led me to this moment.\u00a0Born the\u00a0fifth of seven kids\u00a0in Miami to\u00a0my daddy,\u00a0a construction worker, and\u00a0my mama, a\u00a0school bus driver. My\u00a0parents worked their entire lives to provide me and my siblings with greater opportunities than\u00a0they had ever been afforded.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey dared us\u00a0to\u00a0fly higher than they could see \u2013 and to always pay it forward.\u00a0I can still hear my\u00a0grandmother's voice\u00a0telling me to \"go to school, mind my teachers, get my lesson, and bring\u00a0that education home \u2013 for my brothers, my baby sister, and the kids down the street.\"\nIt was a\u00a0reminder that if we were going to get anywhere, we would get there together.\u00a0My friends,\u00a0this is the story of our party. And it's what drives\u00a0our nominee. \nHillary Clinton has shown us her\u00a0heart, her strength, and\u00a0her\u00a0passion for this country's future. A\u00a0future which\u00a0means\u00a0more to me now than ever before.\u00a0Because in addition to\u00a0being\u00a0Mayor of Tallahassee, Florida, the capital city of our nation's third largest state,\u00a0I'm also\u00a0a father. Along with my wife R. Jai, we are raising two-year-old twins, Jackson and Caroline. \nSo\u00a0when I head to the voting booth, they are coming with me. Because I want them to know that I'm not just casting my vote for Hillary Clinton\u00a0and\u00a0my fellow\u00a0Democrats, I am casting my vote for them.\u00a0\nEnsuring the future they deserve will require\u00a0leadership that can unify and\u00a0inspire\u00a0us. That can\u00a0build on this country's best instincts for inclusion and optimism.\u00a0The world can\u00a0feel scary enough \u2013 without so-called\u00a0leaders\u00a0inciting fear\u00a0for political gain. \nEvery\u00a0day, black parents send\u00a0their\u00a0sons\u00a0out\u00a0with a\u00a0deep sense\u00a0of anxiety, hoping\u00a0they will return safely.\u00a0And\u00a0every\u00a0day, police\u00a0officers\u00a0kiss their loved ones heading to work\u00a0\u2013\u00a0holding that same hope and fear\u00a0in their hearts.\u00a0\nIn these times of anger and fear, we can't afford retreat to our respective corners. We can't let this animosity grow. And we've seen examples of communities and law enforcement coming together during a crisis to grieve together and help each other\u00a0heal.\u00a0That is how it is supposed to work\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and it's on all of us to make that a reality in our communities.\nBecause in the end, we all want the same things. Our fates are inextricably tied together. And with the right leadership,\u00a0we can renew our\u00a0trust\u00a0in one another once more.\u00a0\nI believe\u00a0with every fiber of my being that Hillary Clinton\u00a0is the leader we need. \nSo on that Inauguration Day \u2013 I look forward\u00a0to holding my babies tight\u00a0\u2013 watching history unfold before their\u00a0eyes and shouting with you toward the stage, \"Congratulations, Madam President!\"\nThank you, and God bless!", "I would like to acknowledge my father, who we lost last year. He gave the keynote speech in 1984, and he loved the Democratic Party.\nThe 1984 election was important because it was more about two opposing philosophies than two people. Even more profoundly, at stake this November is not which person or party wins or loses \u2013 at stake is the soul of America. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we heard the Republicans lay out their strategy. Unfortunately, it offered no new solutions. But it's clear that their plan is to fan the flames of fear and offer a scapegoat for our problems. The Trump campaign is marketing a great distraction, using people's fear and anxiety to drive his ratings. Their message comes down to this: Be afraid of people who are different \u2013 religions, colors, language. Stop immigration and the nation will automatically rise.\nIt's not right, it's divisive, it's delusional, and we must expose the truth. \nRepublicans are suffering from short-term memory loss. Unless Republicans are all Native Americans, they are immigrants too! Republicans would cut this nation in half and turn one against the other. It would take our greatest strength \u2013 our diversity \u2013 and make it a weakness. \nFear is a powerful weapon. It can excite and motivate and get people to yell and scream. Fear can even bring you into power. But fear has never created a job, educated a child, and fear will never build a nation. Fear is not strength. Fear is weakness \u2013 no matter how loud you yell \u2013 and our America is never weak.\nRepublicans say they want to make America great again, to take us back to the good old days. What good old days do they want to take us back to? Before the Civil Rights Act? Before minimum wage and worker protection laws? Before Roe v. Wade? \nWe have a different vision for this nation. We want to go forward. They say \"Make America Great Again\"; we say make America greater than ever before. \nImagine how great America can be when every child, rich and poor, is educated; when we judge people by content of character; when we understand that the greatest feast is the one enjoyed by the most people at the table; and when our government has the strength to fight for freedom but the intelligence to know that the strongest four-letter word is not hate but love.\nWe know what Republicans will say: that Democrats are dreamers. We are dreamers, but we are also doers. FDR lifted a nation from its knees. JFK launched our mission to the moon. LBJ enacted voting rights for all. President Obama delivered health coverage for 20 million uninsured Americans.\nMario Cuomo was a dreamer too, but our progressive government is working in New York. We raised the minimum wage to $15 because we insist on economic justice. Enacted paid family leave because all workers deserve dignity. Are rebuilding our middle class by working hand in hand with organized labor. Protecting the environment by banning fracking. Fought the NRA and won and outlawed assault weapons to keep them from the hands of madmen. Passed marriage equality and GENDA, not because the Supreme Court said we must legally but because we believed that we should morally.\nThese are not dreams; they are realities. Progressive government works, and we proved it. And we did it together, without leaving anyone out or anyone behind. Because we believe that we are interconnected and interrelated \u2013 there is a cord that connects you to you and you to you. Maybe you can't see it, but it's there, and it weaves the fabric of community, and when one of us is raised we're all raised, and when one of us is lowered we're all lowered.\nThe Republicans say our vision of community is not possible, but we know it is. Fifteen years ago, on September 11th, we saw death and destruction, unimaginable horror and cruelty; but we saw something else \u2013 we saw this nation come together. We were not Texans, Californians, or New Yorkers. We weren't Democrats, Republicans, or Independents. We weren't Muslims, Christians, or Jews \u2013 we were Americans. We weren't black, white, or brown \u2013 we were red, white, and blue. And we were there for each other as one family. We cried together, we mourned together, and then we got up and we rebuilt together. That was America at its best. \nToday the Freedom Tower stands higher than anything before, a monument to the fact that there is nothing that we can't do when we come together. E pluribus unum \u2013 out of many, one. This is our founding premise and our enduring promise. That is our goal, and Hillary Clinton is the person to make it a reality. \nI spent eight years in the Clinton Administration and worked with Hillary all over the globe. I've seen her in the trenches and in the good days and bad. She stood on the world stage and declared that human rights were women's rights. She fought for health care for all Americans. As Secretary of State, she repaired America's reputation. And she won't just shatter the glass ceiling; she has the vision, intelligence, and qualifications to be a transformative force. She will unify, not divide this nation and move us forward together. That's why we must make Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States!\nAnd that was my father's timeless message in 1984. He was the keynote speaker for this nation's better angels, and he was beautiful. And Pop, wherever you are \u2013 and I think I know where \u2013 at this time of fear, help this country remember what truly makes it great: that we are one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.", "I join you tonight just a kid from Denmark, South Carolina \u2013 where we have three stop lights and a blinking light \u2013 to stand here at this crossroad in our nation's history as proof that anything is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI join you tonight born out of struggle, a product of the Civil Rights Movement, the son of Gwendolyn Sellers and Cleveland Sellers, who missed the birth of his oldest child, my sister, because he was in prison for fighting for what he believed in. They taught me not only the words of Frederick Douglass, \"Without struggle there is no progress,\" but also the words of our state motto: Dum Spiro Spero \u2013 While I breathe, I hope.\nI am a product of their struggle, a product of that hope \u2013 and I'm not the only one.\nThe truth is that every single one of us is a product of struggle. Our lives were made possible through struggle and hope.\nAnd now \u2013 more than ever \u2013 as Democrats we must continue to embrace our history, recognizing that the party of Barack Obama was first the party of Fannie Lou Hamer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. That before there was Hillary Clinton, there was Shirley Chisholm. That once we fought just to be seated, but now I stand before you \u2013 unbowed, unbroken, and unafraid.\nThat's what America is \u2013 an unlikely story of struggle and hope that joins us together as we dare to march forward \u2013 and Hillary Clinton knows that because she's been part of it her entire life. \nThroughout her life, Hillary Clinton has stood for the best of who we are. But she can't do it alone. She needs us \u2013 all of us \u2013 to stand together.\nSo STAND UP if you believe working families deserve affordable healthcare, good schools, and a living wage.\nSTAND UP if you're ready to close the loopholes in our gun laws and pass commonsense reforms. \nSTAND UP if you're ready to keep our communities and our cops safe, and end the structural racism that keeps sending our kids to prison instead of college.\nSTAND UP for Black Lives Matter.\nSTAND UP for progress.\nSTAND UP for justice. \nStand up if you know, like I know, that we're Stronger Together.", "Sen. Barbara Mikulski\nIn 1987, I was the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right. Yes, the history of women in the Senate is that short \u2014 it's about 4'11.\" Though I was the first, I didn't want to be the only. I lit one candle, but I wanted more women, so we could light a torch, and lighten the load on all of you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs our ranks have grown, I've had the privilege of mentoring so many talented women. In 2000, I got a call from one of them. She was considering a Senate run, but she had one question first. She asked me, \"Barb, what can a senator get done?\"\nI told her, \"A lot.\" And boy, did she prove me right. As a senator, she championed the economic security of American families. When Republicans tried to turn Social Security over to the big banks, she helped deliver a knockout blow. When the Supreme Court told Lilly Ledbetter, \"No way on equal pay,\" she pushed for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to guarantee equal pay for equal work. I finished the job, and the Fair Pay Act was the very first bill Barack Obama signed into law. Her name was Hillary Clinton \u2014 and she's going to be our next president. Now, it's time for me to pass the torch to a new generation. So I have just one question: Are you with us?\nFamilies of America, it's time to suit up. With our lipstick on. With our shoes polished. Our shoulders squared. Ready to fight. To put Hillary in the White House. Because we know she'll be carrying the torch for all of us.\nSen. Patty Murray\nYear after year in the Senate, we've faced ridiculous antics from Republicans determined to roll back health care options for women. But, with Hillary Clinton, they never stood a chance. When the Bush Administration tried to block women's access to Plan B contraception, Hillary was by my side\u00a0and ready to fight. Our demand was simple: Base decisions about women's health on science, not political ideology.\nTogether, we stood up to an administration ruled by special interests and the\u00a0extreme right. We refused to back down until the FDA did their job and put science, and women, first. Now, women across America are free to choose safe emergency contraception.\nThat's Hillary. A leader who\u00a0knows\u00a0how to stand her ground,\u00a0fight for what's right, and move our country forward.\nSen. Debbie Stabenow \nIn 1995, I saw Hillary speak at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. It was a tense time in China, and there was a great deal of anticipation around the First Lady's remarks, whether she would speak and what she would say. \nI watched with the crowd of women as she named, one after another, injustices suffered by women around the world. She was calm, determined, and absolutely fearless as she declared that, \"Women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's\u00a0rights.\" As a woman and an American, I was filled with pride. \nThat's Hillary. In Beijing, she broke the silence, and this November, she'll break the glass ceiling once and for all.\nSen. Maria Cantwell \nAs a former businesswoman, I can tell you family and medical leave is a key tool for 21st century jobs. Hillary fought for that. She fought for a higher minimum wage. She knows we build our economy from the middle out. She supports new apprentice programs to train laid-off workers and returning veterans so they can find jobs.\nI watched her help grow the Seattle grassroots organization MomsRising \u2014 fighting for economic security. Now a million members, MomsRising and Hillary are working for paid family leave.\nThat's Hillary. Her opponent might have built buildings and casinos. But Hillary's life work has been building the foundation of an economy that works for everyone.\nSen. Amy Klobuchar \nMinnesota's steelworkers have a group of workers called the Women of Steel. The senators up here are women of steel. Hillary Clinton is a woman of steel!\nHere's my Hillary story. After that devastating earthquake hit Haiti, somewhere in the rubble were dozens of orphans set to be adopted by families in my state. Distraught Minnesota moms were on the ground, looking for their babies. When they called me, I called the only person I knew would help: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She didn't pawn it off. She went to work. She got those babies home.\nThat's Hillary. The friend who takes the call, the mom who gets it done right. Those kids may never know she changed their lives forever, but she did. That's a leader. That's our next president.\nSen. Claire McCaskill \nWe all know that Hillary is the most knowledgeable, most experienced, most capable leader to run for president in a long time. But here's something you may not know: Earlier this year, when I was diagnosed with breast cancer, Hillary called me to check in not once, but several times. She asked me how my treatments were going, she told me to keep up the fight. Her words gave me strength during one of the toughest tests of my life. She didn't do it because I was a senator. There are thousands of people across this country who could tell the exact same story. \nThat's Hillary. She has the intelligence. She has the work ethic. But most importantly, she has heart to lead this country. \nSen. Jeanne Shaheen \nAs all of us here know, our policies abroad have real consequences at home. For 15 years, a printing manufacturer in my state struggled with a foreign trade dispute. The costs to the company were so high, they threatened hundreds of jobs. At Hillary Clinton's confirmation hearing, I brought the issue to her attention. She promised to look into it. Within 90 days, the issue was resolved.\nHere she was, a newly-minted Secretary of State having to get up to speed on every major issue across the globe, and yet she kept her word, and took the time to help out one struggling New Hampshire company. \nThat's Hillary. When you need a champion, there's no one better to have in your corner.\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand \nHillary Clinton has been a mentor to me throughout my career. But long before our first conversation, Hillary spoke to me. In fact, she was speaking to a room full of women, members of a Democratic group I had just joined. But standing in the back of that crowded hall, I felt her calling me out when she said, \"Decisions are being made every day in Washington, and if you're not part of them, you might not like what they decide, and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.\"\nHillary believes that to her core. It's why, after nearly four decades of public service, she's still fighting to make a difference. And it's why I'm proud to fight for her. \nSen. Tammy Baldwin \nWhen I was 9, I was hospitalized for three months with a serious illness. My grandparents raised me and their family health plan didn't cover grandchildren. They had to pay my medical bills out of pocket. Then I was considered a child with a pre-existing condition and they couldn't find me coverage at any price.\nI entered public service to fight for health coverage for all, especially children and young adults. Hillary Clinton has led that fight for decades. With the help of her relentless advocacy, 8 million children are insured and their families more secure. When I got to Congress, I continued Hillary's work to ensure that our most vulnerable children have the care they need. \nThat's Hillary. As President, she'll fight for healthier families and a fair shot for all. \nSen. Mazie Hirono \nI am an immigrant. My mother brought me to America to seek a better future. Growing up, I learned that a better future doesn't just happen. As Americans,\u00a0we\u00a0have to make the change we seek. \nIn college, outraged by Vietnam, I became an activist. When I met Hillary Clinton, I knew I had found a kindred spirit. Hillary is a policymaker with an activist's heart. She knows that the most effective way to make change is to claim a seat at the table.\nBut no matter how high she's climbed, she's never forgotten who she's fighting for. Children. Working families. Immigrants. Small business owners.\nThat's Hillary. Wherever there is someone getting a raw deal, Hillary is with them, fighting to make it right. That's why I'm with Her.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren \nI believe it's important to fight back when powerful people try to rig the system. Guys like Donald Trump will do anything to help the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful, and Trump is willing to step on anyone who gets in his way.\nHillary Clinton knows how to fight back against dangerous, loud-mouthed bullies. For 25 years, she's been on the receiving end of one attack after another. But she doesn't back down. She doesn't whine. She doesn't run to Twitter to give people nasty nicknames. And she sure as heck doesn't quit. Hillary just keeps right on fighting for the people who need her most.\nThat's Hillary. She's battle-tested, and she's the fighter working families need in the White House. \nSen. Barbara Boxer \nWhen Hillary Clinton made history and joined us in the Senate, she wasn't seeking the spotlight. We served on the Environment and Public Works Committee together, and, let me tell you, she was a workhorse. Humble, steady, ready to learn. \nThen, just eight months later, she was thrust into the middle of the WORST attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor. In the dark days that followed 9/11, I saw Hillary's true character. She consoled a grieving population. She sprung into action, securing benefits for the families of the fallen and getting the funding New York needed to rebuild. When Ground Zero responders became sick, she demanded answers from the Bush Administration. And she fought to make sure that they got the health care they need.\nWhen the cameras were off, she never stopped working and never stopped fighting, and that's why members on both sides of the aisle praised her for her dignity, her resolve, and her effectiveness.\nThat's Hillary. In crisis or in calm, whether we need a hand or a heart-to-heart, we can always count on her to come through.\nAs our Dean, Senator Mikulski, likes to say, this election is not about gender, it's about an a-genda, one that includes every American. And we, the Democratic women of the Senate, stand shoulder to shoulder with Hillary, resolved and ready to make her the next President of the United States of America!", "I come from a family of pioneers. My grandparents took on the elements, lived through the Great Depression, survived poverty and family tragedy, and made a place for themselves in New Mexico before it was a state. \nThere, they tilled their land, raised their crops, protected what they had, and tried to help others. I grew up on that small farm. I spent my childhood turning dirt, stacking wood, feeding animals. We didn't have much, but we had each other. We had familia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dad was a union ironworker \u2013 Local 495. My mom had a job with the local school district. They were married for 53 years before Dad passed. Dad's parents before him, Celedon and Nestora, were married even longer: 74 years. Grandpa Celedon, the sheepherder who first put down roots in New Mexico, was born in the era of the horse and buggy \u2013 but he lived to see the space shuttle soar into the heavens. \nMy mom's dad, Grandpa Luis, was a union carpenter who went off to serve in World War II while his wife, Cleotilde, raised the family and was expecting their seventh child. He earned a Bronze Star for his heroism. When I was young, Grandpa Celedon and Grandma Nestora helped care for us. When I was older, Grandpa Luis and Grandma Cleotilde were hurt in a car crash, so we helped care for them. Because that's what families do. \nThose are the values I learned growing up. That's why I'm here today. I know I may not look like your typical member of Congress. And, it's true, I haven't really gotten the bolo tie look to catch on.\nBut the story of my family is the story of millions and millions of other families. It's the story of the great American family. Carpenters and ironworkers, sheepherders and soldiers: Generations of Americans have worked hard and looked out for each other, serving and sacrificing for the next generation.\nWe all gather together to celebrate the good times. We all rally around each other in times of hardship and tragedy. We all try to leave things a little better than we found them. And these values hold true no matter who you are or where you come from. \nAs Democrats, we believe that everybody in America should have the same opportunity my grandparents and parents had: to work hard, to have a place of your own, to build some real economic security that you don't have to worry will disappear overnight, to pass something on to your kids and grandkids. Those are the values that built our party.\nAnd for a century, we have led the fight for Social Security and Medicare, for Pell Grants and the GI Bill, for universal health care, for inclusion, and for quality and opportunity for all.\nWe are proud of our accomplishments. But now it is our turn to continue that tradition. We, too, must work to leave things better than we found them. And Hillary Clinton is the President who will lead us. \nBut she needs a Congress that will work with her. For nearly six years, Republicans have held the majority in the People's House. But clinging to that majority is the only thing they've accomplished. For nearly six years, House Republicans have put party over country. For nearly six years, they've been afraid to stand up to the birthers and bigots and conspiracy theorists \u2013 like the one they just nominated for President.\nMillions of Americans who don't consider themselves Democrats have now joined us in rejecting Donald Trump's bullying, his racism, and his attempts to divide our American family.\nGrowing up, my grandparents shared with me the age old wisdom: Dime\u00a0con\u00a0qui\u00e9n\u00a0andas,\u00a0y\u00a0te\u00a0dir\u00e9\u00a0qui\u00e9n\u00a0eres. Tell me who you walk with, and I'll tell you who you are.\u00a0For me, the choice is easy. I'm for real leadership, someone with character and values. I'm proud to walk with Hillary Clinton.\u00a0\nIf your member of Congress is supporting Donald Trump instead, ask yourself this: What does that say about their leadership? Their character? Their values? If they won't even stand up to Donald Trump, what makes you think they'll stand up for you and your family?\nIt's time for new leaders who will put families first. Leaders who will keep our nation and our neighborhoods safe. Leaders who will help every American family build a more secure financial future. Leaders who will fight to level the playing field, and put the people's voice back in the People's House. I'd like you to meet some of those leaders.\nSecuring our nation, securing our democracy, securing our future: Democrats are focused on what matters most. And the fresh faces we'll elect this November will join a team of Democratic leaders in Congress who, like Hillary Clinton, have spent their lives working to improve the lives of others. \nTogether, we'll work to create jobs and raise wages, secure equal pay for women and paid leave for every family, and make it easier to pay down student debt and possible for every American to attend public college debt-free. If there is one thing you can count on, it's that House Democrats will always be in the fight.\nTonight, Democrats are united. We are passionate. We are fearless. And we are ready to get to work alongside the next President of the United States of America: Hillary Clinton!\nAnd if you are ready to get to work alongside us, then stand with us tonight. Go to DCCC.org/Stronger, and stand with us all the way to November. Because when we stand together, and work together, we win together.\nNow, let's get to work!!\nLogo - https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160420/357779LOGO \nMedia Contact:press@demconvention.com215-398-5252\n\u00a0\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-the-honorable-ben-ray-lujan-300305262.html\nSOURCE  2016 Democratic National Convention Committee\n Related Links\n\nhttps://www.demconvention.com", "Thank you, Democrats! As a New Yorker, I'm quite familiar with both presidential nominees. But despite sharing a home state, these two people are worlds apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was honored to manage Hillary Clinton's first campaign for Senate. Here's the Hillary I know. When she graduated from law school, she could have begun a lucrative career at the prestigious law firm of her choice. Instead, her heart led her to take a noble job at modest pay at the Children's Defense Fund advocating for poor families and children who needed a champion. That is who she is.\nWhat did Donald Trump do? He was born rich; then he made a career out of ripping people off, racking up billions in debt, and bankrupting his companies. Instead of public service or philanthropy, he became one of the least charitable billionaires our country has ever seen. \nWhen Hillary Clinton was First Lady, she made it her personal mission to take on the insurance giants to get health care for every American. Now, despite millions of dollars spent attacking her, she never gave up and helped deliver the Children's Health Insurance Program against all the odds. \nWho did Donald take on? The small business owners he contracted with on his real estate projects. Too many times, Donald simply stiffed them. Now we know Trump is the great pretender. But how can he pretend to be for American workers when he didn't even pay his own workers what he owed them? \nWhen Hillary Clinton was in the Senate, she helped secure 20 billion dollars for our recovery after 9/11, protecting our hero First Responders who sacrificed so much.\nWho did Donald protect? Certainly not the students at Trump University \u2013 a place his own employees called a scam, where vulnerable Americans were pushed to spend more and more money on worthless classes. The only person Donald took care of was himself.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary fought for the dignity of women and girls, passionately fighting the scourge of human trafficking and the horror of child marriage in Saudi Arabia.\nWhat did Donald do? He's called women \"dogs\" and \"fat pigs\" and blamed military sexual assault on the presence of women in our armed forces. He's degraded women to make himself feel big while showing us the truly little man that he is. \nWhen Hillary Clinton raises her right hand on Inauguration Day, she'll be armed with the most progressive agenda in modern times \u2013 one that rewards work instead of wealth, one that flips the script on economic policies \"of, by, and for\" the One Percent.\nFrom paid sick leave and paid family leave to universal pre-K and debt-free college, from ending tax loopholes for Wall Street and billionaire investors to addressing the needs of American cities on housing, infrastructure, and immigration, Hillary Clinton will tackle inequality and be a force for real, progressive change.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, how does Donald see the economic realities facing the American people? Actually, he roots for economic turmoil for his personal gain. Want an example? When asked in 2006 about a possible real estate crash, he said, \"I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy.\" That is the very definition of \"the predator class.\" And now he wants to go further and repeal the new rules we put in place to make Wall Street more accountable. \nThroughout her career, as we heard so clearly last night, Hillary Clinton has taken on the tough battles for one reason: because standing up for those without much power or money has been her life's calling. \nHillary Clinton: She's smart, she's steady, she's right, and she's ready!\nDonald Trump: He's reckless, he's risky, he's wrong, and he's scary!\nIf you care about fighting income inequality, about lifting up families and children, about building up America's great cities, then let's come together, fight together, and let's elect Hillary Clinton the next president of these United States! \nThank you!", "My name is Cedric Richmond. I'm proud to represent Louisiana \u2014 \"the Who Dat Nation\" \u2014 in Congress!\nI'm able to stand here today because my mother was a strong woman.\u00a0After my\u00a0father died, for a while she had to do the job of two parents.\u00a0But she didn't do it alone.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u00a0required the help of school teachers, baseball coaches,\u00a0our elders, and especially the church.\nAnd it took a strong Democratic Party that invested in our communities \u2014 that invested in me.\u00a0\nThrough blood, sweat, and tears, our elders and our party created the environment for me to succeed. Because of that blood, that sweat, and those tears, I can sit, eat, and live\u00a0wherever I want. I can vote without answering how many bubbles are in a bar of soap. And because of blood, sweat, and tears, the Obamas\u00a0reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\nAs the poet Robert Frost wrote:\nThe woods are lovely, dark and deep,But I have promises to keep,And miles to go before I sleep.\nWe have made great strides under President Obama, but we still have miles to go. \nWhen our kids have better access to guns and drugs than to textbooks and computers, we have miles to go before we sleep. \nWhen women don't make the same wage as a man, we have miles to go before we sleep. \nWhen we can't get Republicans to join us to enact sensible gun reform \u2014 even after Newtown and Sandy Hook and Dallas and Baton Rouge \u2014 we have miles to go before we sleep. \nWhen the NRA has neutered the Republican Party, we have miles to go before we sleep. \nWe need Hillary Clinton because she doesn't sleep.\nSo this fall, when you are out there campaigning for Hillary, and you start to feel exhausted to the point that you just can't go on \u2014 do me a favor: Make just one more call or knock one more door. \nBecause we still have miles to go before we sleep.", "There are days when I wish I hadn't been there. Moments when I try to forget the things I saw, the things I heard, that soul-crushing morning at the firehouse in Sandy Hook. The grief, the unending, mind-altering, paralyzing sorrow that comes with losing a child to gun violence, is unimaginable. Only those who live it, know it. In Newtown, Connecticut, families of 20 first graders and their six teachers live it every minute of every day. And across the country, each day, 90 families join them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy oldest son is the same age as those kids in Sandy Hook. He just finished first grade. My wife and I are the same age as those parents. And I am furious, furious, that in three years since Sandy Hook, three years of almost daily bloodshed in our cities, the Republican Congress has done absolutely nothing to prevent the next massacre. It stokes inside me a sense of outrage I've never felt before. And that's what drove me to stand on the floor of the United States Senate for 15 hours to demand change.\nAnd I'm here today because I want a president who shares that same sense of outrage. Outrage that the gun lobby fights to keep open glaring loopholes that 90 percent of Americans want closed. Outrage that a suspected terrorist can walk into a store and walk out with a military-style, semi-automatic rifle. \nHillary Clinton didn't have to make fighting gun violence a centerpiece of her campaign. I'm sure people told her it wasn't worth the political risk. But she held firm. She stood up to the NRA and pledged to take Washington back from the gun lobby. And Donald Trump? When he sees gun violence devastating our communities, he sees opportunity. Another opportunity to convince Americans that they should fear one another. Another opportunity to do the bidding of the gun lobby.\nNinety percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales, so that dangerous weapons don't fall into the wrong hands. But, Trump says that in his first hour in the Oval Office, he would roll back safeguards we already have. And even more sinister, Trump said that by the end of his first day in office, he'll mandate that every school in America allow guns in their classrooms. Think about that for a moment, of all the things that Donald Trump could have promised to do on his first day in office, he chose weakening background checks and putting guns in elementary schools.\nThis is a fate we cannot accept. And my friends, there is no reason to feel helpless about the horrifying trajectory of cascading massacres. We can change this. Smart gun policy, like background checks, can change this.\nI stood on the Senate floor for 15 hours because I had had enough. Enough of children dying in classrooms. Enough of nightly bloodshed on our city streets. Enough of our police officers being outgunned, ambushed, and cut down in the line of duty. Enough. It's time to take Washington back from the gun lobby. And I know just how to do it.\nStart by texting the word LAWS to 47246. Learn about the dangerous loopholes in our gun laws and turn yourself into an activist. Then, elect Hillary Clinton as the next President of the United States, a leader who has the empathy, and the guts, to declare with every fiber of her being that we have had enough.", "Hello, Democrats! \nIt's an honor to represent Colorado, my family's home for six generations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Colorado, we share a unique heritage, built on the promise of progress you can only find in the American West. \nI come from Native American and Mexican descendants, French trappers, and Spanish pioneers. \nI come from ranchers, who continue to harvest the land, and laborers, like my Grandpa Ernest, who worked in the CF&I Steel Mill in Pueblo for 33 years to provide for his family. \nAnd I come from strong women like my Grandmother Eva, who had to leave school after the 3rd grade to care for her younger siblings. \nGrowing up, my family wasn't rich. In fact, my parents relied on food stamps for a time to get by.\nBut, in America, we don't define our value by our net worth. \nMy parents gave me the name, Crisanta, believing that, in an inclusive America, it would not be a wall to my success. \nThey encouraged me to work hard and get an education, believing that, in a fair America, it would carry me anywhere I wanted to go.\nAnd you know what? They were right. \nOnly in America could a shy little girl from Northglenn and Arvada, Colorado grow up to break glass ceilings and serve as the Majority Leader of the Colorado House of Representatives.\nSo, to every shy little girl or boy out there listening, I want to say: No matter who you are, no matter where you're from, or how you got here, you are special. And your potential is as big as America itself.\nThat's what Hillary Clinton believes. It's why she's spent a lifetime fighting for every child.\nFor a strong social safety net, so no one falls through the cracks.\nFor world-class public schools, so education can be a great equalizer.\nFor a government that respects and protects the rights of all people, so what we look like and who we love has no bearing on our opportunities.\nWe are a country where anything is possible when everyone is included. And I am proof of that.\nI am proud to fight for a President who not only shares those values, she lives them.", "Great Spirit, we seek your blessing and guidance on this convention and the wonderfully diverse group of people gathered here from across this great nation of ours. Help us to be mindful of the importance of this endeavor to the country and to the democracy we are so privileged to live under. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, help us to appreciate our diversity, to respect differences in our cultures, traditions, beliefs, and to show tolerance and understanding of others, as we grapple with the critical issues facing our country. Give us the strength to put aside our differences, and unite in the face of challenges and adversity. \nHelp us to make this country, and the world, a more just, safer, and healthier place for all humankind. Teach us to respect Mother Earth, recognizing the wonderful way that she can provide for us when we do so. Help us to be mindful of, and generous towards, those who are less fortunate than us. \nGuide and protect our leaders, both those gathered here today and those who are not, and encourage them to act wisely and unselfishly.\nThank you for all you have given us, and particularly for the extraordinarily bounteous and beautiful country we share.\nAmen.", "Fellow Americans, fellow delegates \u2014 I am privileged to represent the almost 700,000 American citizens, growing by 1,000 every month, in your nation's capital.\n\nWe are so proud of our city, with a budget larger than that of 13 states, that we want to become the 51st state of the United States!\n\nWe are home to our most powerful institutions, yet we have been denied our power as American citizens. The power we seek is ordinary, not lofty. It is the democratic power of equal citizenship. It is the power of local control over our $4 billion in locally-raised funds \u2014 30 states rely more on federal funds to balance their annual budgets than DC does. It is the power of local control over purely local laws \u2014 like our gun safety laws that Republicans try to eliminate every year. And, yes, it is also the democratic power that gave birth to the nation itself\u2014the quid pro quo power of the vote in the House and Senate in return for the taxes we pay.\n\nDC residents not only pay taxes without representation, we pay the highest federal taxes per capita in the United States \u2014 with no votes in the House and Senate to show for those taxes.\n\nFor lack of voting rights, our nation's founders declared their independence and dared their opponents to stop them.\n\nDC residents are not declaring independence from our country. We are declaring our intention to join our country as the 51st state.\n\nRepublicans say DC wants too much, stating in their platform that our taxpaying citizens are \"a special responsibility of the federal government\" and calling \"by whatever means necessary\" to undermine, not increase, DC's local sovereignty.\n\nIn dramatic contrast, our Democratic platform says: \"Restoring our democracy \u2026 means passing statehood for the District of Columbia.\" Our nominee says, \"as President, I will be a vocal champion for DC statehood.\"\n\nNever before has a presidential nominee taken office with so solid a promise for full and equal citizenship for D.C. residents. And listen up America: A nominee who will stand up for DC will stand up for you too.\n\nHillary for President. Statehood for DC!", "Let me begin by issuing a heartfelt invitation to our Republican friends: If your party is no longer becoming to you, then you should be coming to us. I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years. And let me tell you, she's never let me down. And she won't let you down either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spite of what you heard last week, it is not midnight in America. Midnights can be cold and crippling. In reality, the sun has barely risen over the vastness of these United States. It is dawn in America and we are in the process of becoming. Yes, we are not yet what we shall become.\nAt a time when the citizens of this amazing country are jittery over a multitude of fears and heartaches, we need a leader who will become a trafficker in optimism and a peace peddler. Hillary will build a future we can all be part of and proud of. \nThere's an old story about Andrew Jackson. As a child, he looked like anything but a future general or president. In fact, one of his boyhood friends said Jim Brown who lived in the same area, could throw Andrew to the ground three times out of four in wrestling matches. Years later, a writer asked, \"Why was there four matches? Jim should have won since in wrestling, if a person is thrown three times, it's all over. So what happened?\" \"Well, Jim would throw ole Andy BUT he'd get right up. Jim could never win because Andy wouldn't stay throwed \u2013 he wouldn't stay throwed!\" \nHere is a warning to those who might be tempted to spend the next four years trying to knock Hillary Clinton down: You'd better get ready for a woman who won't stay throwed.\nThey threw her down as the First Lady of the United States, but she wouldn't stay throwed.\nThey threw her down as a U.S. Senator, but she wouldn't stay throwed.\nThey threw her down as Secretary of State, but she wouldn't stay throwed.\nThey threw her down in this very presidential campaign, but she wouldn't stay throwed.\nNo, she ain't throwed yet!", "Good evening. Buenas noches.\n\nIt's great to be here from Los Angeles, a city with such a huge, thriving Latino population that we expect Donald Trump to build a wall around us.\n\nWhen I have traveled through this country, from the Midwest, where my wife grew up, to the Deep South, where I became a Navy officer, to towns across the Southwest I visited during this campaign, I heard Americans anxious about their future. And after last week's convention in Cleveland, I can understand why. There, instead of ideas, it was insults. Instead of policy, it was polarization. Instead of hope, there was hatred.\n\nAs a mayor, I'm here to tell you: America's cities don't have time for theatrics. America's cities have urgent problems to solve. Local leaders across America support Hillary Clinton because she understands that, and we are prepared to confront and solve these problems together, just as we are in my hometown.\n\nIn Los Angeles, we looked at America's crumbling infrastructure and started fixing it \u2013 putting more than 500,000 people and $50 billion to work repairing our roads and building our port, airport, and railways.\n\nIn Los Angeles, we saw too many Americans living in poverty, so we became the biggest city in America to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, inspiring other cities and states to do the same.\n\nIn Los Angeles, we saw too many lives lost to gun violence, so we banned high-capacity magazines and we are taking illegal guns off our streets.\n\nIn Los Angeles, we saw too many high school dropouts and too many graduates in debt, so we are making community college free.\n\nWe didn't do any of this by finding a common enemy. We found a common purpose. America doesn't need a political pyromaniac for president.\n\nDonald Trump has no vision for our country and no genuine answer to our challenges. His voice is loud, his language is coarse, and his politics has a darkness that would not only stop, but reverse the march of progress toward the greater, more prosperous, more equal America we can and must become.\n\nElect Donald Trump and get empty promises and no plan for our country.\n\nElect Hillary Clinton and put $500 billion and more than 6 million Americans to work rebuilding our infrastructure.\n\nElect Hillary Clinton and raise the minimum wage across the country.\n\nElect Hillary Clinton and reduce gun violence on our streets.\n\nElect Hillary Clinton and make college debt-free.\n\nWe did it in L.A.; we've done it as Democrats across America's cities; now let's do it for the entire country. That's Hillary Clinton's vision \u2014 a united America working together. And that vision makes it possible for me to be here tonight.\n\nI'm just your average Mexican-American Jewish Italian, but my ancestors, faced with war and persecution, crossed oceans and rivers to come to this improbable, miraculous democracy.\n\nMy grandfather, Salvador, was carried over the border in his mother's arms, during the Mexican revolution. My other grandfather, Harry, was the son of Russian Jews fleeing persecution. They and their wives, Juanita and Julia, a meatpacker and public school teacher, made lives here.\n\nAnd after Pearl Harbor, one of my grandfathers answered his nation's call and manufactured uniforms for GIs.\n\nThe other put that uniform on, crossed an ocean not knowing if he'd ever come back to fight for the only country he knew, and as a result earned his citizenship.\n\nToday, their grandson is the mayor of the biggest city in the biggest state in this union, humbled to stand before you.\n\nAmerica works best when every strand is woven into our national fabric. Some of us make the uniforms. Some of us wear the uniforms. But we all have a role to play.\n\nWhen we mock immigrants, women, Indians, or people with disabilities, we mock our own history. This is a country where Navajo code talkers, and mothers on assembly lines, and Japanese-American GIs whose families were in internment camps, won a war led by a president who couldn't walk.\n\nThat is the great work that lies ahead \u2013 together, to build a nation stronger than the one we inherited.\n\nThat is the great work that Hillary Clinton will lead us in as the next President of the United States.\n\nHermanos y hermanas, juntos somos m\u00e1s fuertes.\n\nWe are Stronger Together. \n\nThank You.", "Hello, fellow Democrats!

Those values \u2014 liberty, diversity, opportunity \u2014 are fundamentally American values. Those values are under attack, not just by enemies abroad, but by a GOP that moved its fearmongering fringe to center stage. \nWhat Trump presented last week wasn't political discourse, it wasn't even political incorrectness. What Trump presented last week was defeatist and retreatist. Never has a speech been so long, with so little substance, science, humanity, humor, or hope. His hostile takeover of the American Dream is built on two fundamental lies: That America is a dark and desperate place, and that he has any kind of a plan to make it better. Trump strangled the sunny optimism of Ronald Reagan and replaced \"tear down that wall\" with the cynical bigotry of \"build that wall.\" Contempt for the Constitution, inhumane mass deportation, malice toward different views and different hues. Those are disqualifications from any office, let alone the highest office in the land.\nWhile it's refreshing to finally see an openly gay man speak at a Republican convention, it doesn't remove the stain of selecting Mike Pence, America's most anti-LGBTQ governor. Pence supported overt discrimination and even advocated diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called \"conversion therapy.\" That's not \"praying away the gay;\" it's emotional torture against our most innocent citizens, our children. Telling them that to live, they must lie. About who they are, and who they love. That's fundamentally un-American. The age-old choice has never been more clear: We can live our fears or live our dreams.\nHillary Clinton has dedicated her life to putting the American Dream within reach. She believes in diversity over division. The hard work of pluralism over the \"illusion of differences.\" \nAnd as a father of four, I want to say something to all the children who are watching and listening at home. When you hear people say that you and your family don't matter because of who you are, or where you came from, or what you look like, or who you love, I want you to know one thing: The people in this room, and all across the country, believe that you matter.\nHillary Clinton believes you matter. We believe that you belong here. We need you here. We believe that you can be whoever you are, and become whatever you want to be. And we're going to fight for you, not just over the next 100 days, but over the next 100 years. Because, no matter what people tell you, that's what America is about, and that's what makes America great.", "\"Fat pigs.\" \"Dogs.\" \"Disgusting.\" That's what Donald Trump has called women. Is that what he sees in the daughters, mothers, and grandmothers of this country? Is that how he sees our place in America? \nI am here from the great state of Wisconsin \u2013 the Badger State. I am here to tell you that I see things very differently! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am here to tell you that Hillary Clinton sees it differently too.

Too many women have experienced sexual violence and abuse. And I'm one of them. But we are not victims. We are survivors. \nWe have been bullied, beaten, and berated. Told to sit down and to shut up. Well, my voice matters, and I won't shut up. \nOur voices matter, and we won't shut up. Women make our communities better \u2013 stronger each and every day. That's why Hillary Clinton has spent her life fighting for us. \nShe has fought to get equal pay for equal work. She has defended our right to make our own health care decisions. She has the battle scars from advocating for paid family leave and for affordable health care. Hillary Clinton has stood up to be counted when it counted for women. I trust Hillary, because at every turn and at every opportunity, Hillary has been the voice for the underrepresented and overlooked. And as President, she'll keep fighting for all of us! \nLike Hillary, I am a grandmother. And I raised my granddaughters to stand proud and to stand strong. Now they give me strength. They are my joy, my inspiration, and my strength. I know the vision that I have for their future. I know the vision Hillary Clinton has for their America. \nDonald Trump is telling us to sit down, to be quiet. Hillary is asking us to stand up. She is asking us to be heard. \nMy fellow Democrats, stand with Hillary because she stands with us. And, yes, because we are Stronger Together. \nThank you. \nGod bless our nominee, and God bless America.\nI love you.", "I spend a lot of time in the Republican Senate, so it's nice to be in a room that respects reason and facts! I appreciate the tribute, but anything I've accomplished in the Senate, I owe to the great teammates I've had: my Democratic Senate Caucus; Nancy Pelosi in the House; President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden. And I give a never-ending tribute to our next President, Hillary Clinton!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a team, we've fought for the belief that affordable health care is a right, not a privilege. As a team, we've fought for the idea that you shouldn't get the bill for Wall Street's bad bets. As a team, we've fought for the promise that your hard-earned Social Security is a sacred trust.\nDonald Trump and Mike Pence want to put insurance companies back in charge of your health. Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to let big banks run wild again. And Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to gamble with your retirement benefits in the stock market. Republicans want to tear down the pillars of middle-class security. We won't let that happen!\nI've never seen anything more craven than Mitch McConnell and what he has done to our democracy. His Republican Party decided that the answer to hard-working Americans' dreams is to slander our African-American President, stoke fear of Muslims, sow hatred of Latinos, insult Asians, and, of course, wage war against women. In other words, the only thing Republicans, like Mitch McConnell, have accomplished is setting the stage for a hateful con man, Donald Trump.\nWhen Trump decided to run for President, he probably said to himself: \"I'm an egomaniac. I don't believe in science. \nI think women are inferior. Where would I feel at home?\"\nParents: You're right to worry about your children hearing what comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. Republicans: You should have been careful, also, because Donald learned it from watching you!\nThey say they believe in \"Country First.\" What a joke. Republicans who won't stand up to Trump believe in one thing and one thing only: \"Party First.\" And this year, 2016, they've gone even further, nominating the poster child of \"Me First.\" Trump knew that hateful rhetoric and dangerous policies are the way to win in today's GOP. But that's not how you win in America. And that's not how America wins in the world.\nDemocrats know we win with an economy that works for everybody. With a strong, smart national security that values our allies. And we know winning is the work of a team.\nWith Hillary in the White House and a majority in the Senate, Democrats will keep fighting for immigration reform that keeps America true; clean energy that keeps America strong; a Supreme Court that keeps America just, and background checks for gun buyers and an assault-weapons ban that keep America safe.\nSince my boxing days, I've fought my share of fights. In my 50 years of fighting for Nevadans, I've also realized a leader is actually a corner man: someone who stands on your side, who has your back in a fight. Middle-class families fighting to give your kids a better life \u2013 Democrats stand in your corner. Americans fighting for the equality and respect our nation promises you \u2013 we're in your corner. New Americans risking everything to get here, and then fighting to make it here \u2013 we're in your corner.\nYou're the ones fighting the hardest fights. You're the ones who need leaders in your corner. Leaders like my forever friend, Bernie Sanders. Leaders like Catherine Cortez Masto, who is going to help Democrats take back the Senate. Leaders who never back down, and oh, do we like Tim Kaine? Leaders who have had your back their whole lives, like Hillary Clinton, the most qualified and prepared candidate in the history of America.\nIn a few months, I'll be stepping out of the ring, one last time. But Democrats will always \u2013 always \u2013 be in your corner. So together, let's keep fighting, together; fighting the good fight!", "My Fellow Democrats, and hello, South Carolina!\nAs the father of three daughters and grandfather of two adorable granddaughters, I am proud to stand before you as we prepare to offer the American people an opportunity to smash through the ultimate glass ceiling in our nation by nominating for President of the United States a person who is more qualified \u2014 by education and training, experience and temperament \u2014 than anyone who has ever offered for the job. And when it comes to current pursuers, it ain't even close. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes we seek for our great country will not come easy. To achieve a stronger and better America, we need a leader who is willing and able to fight for the dreams of all Americans.\u00a0If there's one thing I know about Hillary Clinton it is this: She is a fighter. And she fights with her head and her heart.\u00a0\nIn my home state of South Carolina, we often say, \"you can best tell what a person will do by looking at what he or she has done.\" When she graduated from law school, Hillary Clinton came to South Carolina to help reform our juvenile justice system and traveled across the region to help make the 1965 Voting Rights Act real in the lives of all Americans.\nIn Arkansas, she fought to reform education. As First Lady, she fought for universal health care and succeeded in helping secure the Children's Health Insurance Program that provides health care for millions of children and laid the groundwork for the Affordable Care Act.\nAs a Senator and Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton always worked to advance our nation's \"pursuit of a more perfect union.\" Hillary Clinton knows we must take effective action on the issue of income inequality. She has embraced the Congressional Black Caucus's 10-20-30 plan to target federal resources into areas of persistent poverty. Hillary Clinton's first policy speech in this campaign was on criminal justice reform. She will work to get rid of mandatory minimums, mass incarcerations, and private for-profit prisons.\nHillary Clinton does not fear getting outside of her comfort zone. She knows that we are stronger as a nation when we work together. She embodies our nation's motto, E Pluribus Unum, out of many one. \nJohn F. Kennedy challenged us to reach for the moon, and we did. Lyndon Baines Johnson courageously tackled poverty and inequality in America; his achievements continue to lift our communities and sustain our citizens. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. pointed us to the mountaintop, and although we are not there yet, we are still climbing. And with President Hillary Clinton, America will rise even further.\n\u200eMy standing before you tonight is a testament to the strength of our party, the goodness of our people, and the greatness of our nation. Our nation is strong, but we can be stronger. Americans are good, but we can be better. America is great, but it can be greater. \nMy fellow Democrats, America's brightest days are yet to come. We have bigger and better things to achieve. But achieving bigger and better things requires working harder and working together. Let's emerge from Philadelphia working together to make our nation stronger, Americans better, and America greater by electing Hillary Rodham Clinton the next President of the United States. \nGod bless you and God bless these United States of America.", "Me yah whae! \u00a0\nI'm a Native American and Chairman of my tribe, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike tribes across the United States, we have faced hardship and discrimination. Our ancestors fought to preserve our tribes and our culture, just as I do today. \nHillary Clinton is the leader that all of Indian Country needs. She is the leader for our America. \nAh Cha Ma.", "I want to speak tonight to those Americans who feel you've been left behind. Who believe you've been cheated. Who believe that those at the top don't care about you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know a little something about that. I was Governor of Michigan \u2013 the epicenter of America's manufacturing rise, and its fall, AND its resurgence. Michigan built the automobile and the automobile built America. But when the manufacturing industry fell on hard times, so did Michigan. We were angry about it \u2013 about jobs going to low-wage countries. About unfair trade. \nBut we were also determined to build industries of the future. We said we wanted advanced manufacturing. We wanted new jobs. We started the hard process of moving in that direction. And then, in 2008, we elected a Democratic President for us to work with. And you know what he did?\nHe saved the American auto industry. And then that renewed auto industry paid America back in full.\nAnd THAT'S what we can do when we work together. \nI'm a fierce Democrat. But I know there are Democrats AND Republicans across the country who want to create jobs in America. Liberals and conservatives. Public sector and private industry. Because we're not in this alone \u2013 we're all in this together.\nOne candidate for President gets that. And one candidate, as Joe Biden said last night, doesn't have a clue.\nSome people are worried. Some people are angry. I get that. But the answer isn't to tear our country down, it's to build our country up.\nNot to build walls that keep the rest of the world OUT, but to keep building the industries and universities that the rest of the world wishes they could get into.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHillary Clinton gets it.\u00a0 \nThat's why she has huge plans to create good-paying jobs in America.\nImagine that \u2013 actual plans! I must have missed that night of the Republican Convention!\nDetailed plans, people! Written down! With numbers! That add up!\u00a0 \u00a0\nWanna see them? You can actually see them! Just text JOBS to 47246. \nNow, last week, we heard Trump's hopeless vision of our country. Then he said: \"I alone can fix it.\"\nImagine Donald Trump's version of the Constitution: \"I, the person, in order to form a more perfect union\u2026\"\nOr, centuries later, \"I, shall overcome.\"\nOr, \"Ask not what I can do for my country, ask what my country can do for me!\"\nDonald: You're so vain, you probably think this speech is about you. \nHere's what I know: WE have to stop Donald Trump! \nOur great country spans a continent, but we're all connected to each other, no matter where we live.\nWhen a miner in Virginia has the dignity of a new job in the advanced steel industry, we ALL have dignity.\u00a0 \u00a0\nWhen the engineering student in the Sunshine State builds the solar panels of the future, we ALL succeed. \nWhen the autoworker in Detroit builds the electric vehicle, that drives all of us forward. Right? Whether you're in Michigan or Maryland or Missouri or Montana.\nAnd this, too: When Flint's water poisons its children, that hurts all of us. These are our children. We are all Flint! \nRight, Philadelphia? \nOur next President knows that a nation is a village. That we are ONE family. \nAnd in a family, NO ONE gets left behind: Not the steelworker in Pennsylvania! Not the farmer in Iowa! Not the DREAMer in Nevada! Not the factory worker in Ohio! \nAs our next president says we're Stronger Together. \nWe're Stronger. How? Together! \nWe're going to keep America great. How? Together!\nAnd we're going to work our hearts out to elect Hillary Clinton President. How? Together! \nLet's do this, brothers and sisters! Together!", "As we just saw, climate change is unlike any other threat we humans face. It is overarching and affects the entire earth and all living things. It is slow. It is relentless. And it is subject to irreversible tipping points and vast unknowns.\nCombating climate change, the existential threat of our time, will take heroic effort on the part of many people and many nations.\u00a0Make no mistake, climate change is REAL. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of world leaders and climate scientists, like those at NASA and the Department of Defense \u2013 indeed, almost anyone who chooses to think \u2013 believes in the science of climate change and sees the moral imperative to take action. But you wouldn't know it by listening to Donald Trump.\nLast week at the Republican Convention, for 76 long and painful minutes, Trump conjured up a host of dark threats, but never once mentioned the words \"climate change\" or \"global warming.\" What do you expect? Trump represents a party with officials that have banned state employees from even using these words in Florida, and who knows where else.\nTrump says global warming is a hoax. I say Trump is a fraud. Trump says there's no drought in California. I say Trump lies. So, it's not surprising that Trump chose as his running mate a man who denies that there's such a thing as evolution.\nRarely in American history have two parties diverged so profoundly. Even the Know-Nothing, anti-immigrant party of the 1850s did not stray this far into sheer ignorance and dark fantasy as have the Republicans and their leader Donald Trump.\nOur candidate, Hillary Clinton, couldn't be more different. While Trump talks, and talks, and talks, Hillary gets stuff done. She fights for us on big issues. As Secretary of State, she paved the way for the historic Paris Climate Agreement, an agreement which 200 nations, including China and India, enthusiastically embraced. And Mr. Trump, he says: The world be damned; I'm tearing it up.\nHillary is the one who launched the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a group of nations taking action to reduce black carbon and other super climate pollutants, which cause severe lung and heart damage. And from her first day in office, President Hillary Clinton will do what's needed to combat climate change and lead the clean energy revolution.\nWe know something about this in California. We have solar, wind, zero-emission cars, energy efficiency, and yes, a price on carbon. We're proving that even with the toughest climate laws in the country, our economy is growing faster than almost any nation in the world.\nMr. Trump and those who live in climate denial say otherwise. They tell us we have to choose between saving the economy and saving the planet. Donald Trump and the climate deniers are dead wrong \u2014 dangerously wrong. \nWhat America needs today are not deniers, but leaders. Not division, but common purpose. Not bombast, but bold action. That's why we need Hillary. And that's why the American people will choose her as the next President of the United States.", "In 1922, my grandmother came to Texas from Mexico. She wasn't a rapist or a murderer. She was a six-year-old orphan. As a girl, she walked past storefront signs that read \"No Dogs or Mexicans Allowed.\" Her life wasn't easy. And she didn't always feel welcomed. But she never stopped believing in America's sacred promise that her sacrifices would be rewarded with opportunity for herself and her family. She kept up her part of the promise by working her whole life: babysitting, cooking, and cleaning houses. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the fact that her grandson is standing here on this stage is proof that America kept its promise, too. \nMy brother, Juli\u00e1n, and I know that our story isn't unique. This room is filled with proud Americans who can tell similar stories. Great-grandchildren of Irish immigrants who saw signs that said \"No Irish Need Apply\" and just worked harder. Grandchildren of Americans who suffered in World War II internment camps \u2014 the same camps Donald Trump has defended \u2014 and grew up to be business owners, war heroes, and public servants. Children of immigrants who have contributed to our country as doctors, police officers, and \u2014 guess what \u2014 impartial judges.\nTheir story is our story. It's America's story. And make no mistake: The hero of that story is never the one who sides with hate. The hero of that story will never be Donald Trump. Americans know that the choices he offers are false ones. \nProsperity is not a zero-sum game. We can create millions of new jobs and raise the minimum wage. National security is not a zero-sum game. We can keep America safe and still welcome the next generation of immigrants without a religious litmus test. Justice is not a zero-sum game. We can back our brave men and women in blue and still believe that Black Lives Matter. These aren't zero-sum games. They aren't games at all. \nBut do you know how many plans Donald Trump has to accomplish these things? Zero!\nWhile Donald Trump is talking about building walls, Hillary Clinton is working to build an infrastructure of opportunity \u2014 a way for Americans to get where they want to go in life: great schools to prepare us for college and career, a strong health care system, and an economy where no one who works full time lives in poverty.\nRepublicans would have you believe creating opportunity means giving tax breaks to corporations and the super wealthy. Well, I've met a lot of Americans in my life. And not one of them has ever told me that their family came to this country looking for the lowest corporate tax rate. \nThe promise of America is much bigger than that. And there's room in it for everyone. Donald Trump isn't going to keep that promise. He's not even going to try. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will. \nThat's why I'm asking all of you to go to \"IWillVote.com.\" Make sure you're registered. Make sure you know where to go. Make sure the next chapter of our great American story is written by us!\nMy grandmother believed America was the greatest nation in the world. \nAnd I'm with Hillary so our grandkids will believe that, too.", "Thirty years ago, almost to the day, I lost my job. Whether it's being laid off, downsized, or fired, it's not funny, and not a reality show punchline when it happens to you. And it wasn't just me, a whole generation of geologists lost their careers in that recession. It is hard when you feel you aren't wanted anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter many months, with hardly an interview, a buddy and I decided to start the first brewpub in Colorado. We had no money. Even my own mother wouldn't invest. Finally, 18 months later, we opened in an abandoned warehouse district. We got 34 small investors, two bank loans, a loan from the city, and a loan from the SBA. And slowly but surely, we grew, and thrived, and expanded. \nNow I've never hosted a reality TV show, but I know that the true mark of a successful businessman is not the number of times you say, \"You're fired\"; it's the number of times you say, \"You're hired.\" That's right, I'm a business guy. But unlike that other candidate's businesses, my business didn't go bankrupt six times.\nSuccess is sweeter when it's shared \u2014 and that's just as true in business as it is in life.\nIn the neighborhood in which we opened our brewpub, there were a handful of other entrepreneurs trying to develop lofts or start businesses. Together, we worked with the Downtown Denver Partnership, the tourism board, and the city to create a sense of place. More entrepreneurs arrived to start more businesses. The neighborhood took off, and so did Denver. \nSure, it was my buddy and I who took the risk. But as Hillary Clinton says, \"It takes a village\" \u2013 businesses, government, the community \u2013 working together to create opportunity. She understands that even in Colorado, land of \"rugged individualism,\" our economy is Stronger Together. \nAs a small businessman, then mayor of Denver, and now governor, I've seen how partnerships drive economies. Today, Denver is the fastest-growing big city in America, and Colorado has the second strongest economy in the country. Compare that to Donald Trump's trickle-down economics \u2013 where he doesn't pay his bills and small businesses go out of business. \nI've spent time with Hillary and I can tell you, from a small business perspective, she gets it. Tremendous changes in our economy are making people feel that they aren't wanted anymore. I know the feeling. Many of the skills that would have been tickets to the middle class are no longer needed. That's why we discussed not only the importance of education and training, but streamlining regulations, expanding access to loans, incentivizing innovation, and how to support the transformation of new ideas into jobs. I told her about Colorado's new apprenticeship initiative that allows kids to both work, and take classes that allow them to be more successful in their jobs. \nAnd Hillary Clinton understands that, especially in these economic times, partnerships can lead to opportunity, which is why she wants to offer tax breaks to companies that offer apprenticeships in underserved areas.\nShe's going to make the largest investment in jobs since World War II. She'll cut red tape and taxes so it's easier to start and grow a small business. Hillary Clinton is going to work for the young entrepreneur who wants to open a brewpub, or launch a start-up, or even create a drapery business, just like her dad, Hugh Rodham, did all those years ago in Chicago.\nTonight, Hillary Clinton accepts the nomination for President of the United States. Tomorrow, we're going to get down to business.\nWe all have a job to do: electing Hillary Clinton. Let's get to work!", "Good evening, fellow Democrats! I'm thrilled to see so many people from the great state of Ohio here tonight.\nIt is an honor to be here on this historic evening, when we move one step closer to electing the 45th President of these United States of America. Yes, united not divided. I emphasize \"united\" because \u2014 like Hillary Clinton \u2014 I know that we are\u00a0Stronger Together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis election to me is about choosing between two fundamentally different visions of America, and I believe the choice is crystal clear.\nHillary Clinton is by far the most experienced, qualified, and skilled candidate. She cares deeply about each and every American: no matter what you look like, where you are from, or who you love.\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, is the most divisive and\u00a0ill-prepared candidate we've seen in modern times \u2014 looking to wind back the clock on all the progress we have made as a nation together. He has built a career on intimidation, discrimination, and bullying \u2014 at the expense of and on the backs of small businesses and hardworking families.\nIn contrast, Hillary Clinton has devoted her entire career to lifting up hardworking families, women, and small businesses.\u00a0\nI want you and all Americans to know the Hillary Clinton that I know.\u00a0The Hillary who sits with me and talks about her\u00a0grandchildren,\u00a0Charlotte and Aidan, and my grandchildren, Leah and Spencer.\nThe Hillary who sees unlimited potential in every child.\nThe Hillary who fights for civil rights and freedom for all.\nThe Hillary who will fight for the hope of a brighter future, a more inclusive America, and greater global peace and cooperation. \nAmericans want a Commander-in-Chief, not a Divider-in-Chief.\nI know which one I choose, and that is the future 45th President of the United States of America, my good friend, Hillary Clinton!\nI am Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, and I approve this message. God bless you, and God bless these UNITED States of America.", "Good evening, everyone. I am Karen Weaver, and I am the mayor of the great city of Flint, Michigan. Flint is a community of 100,000 strong, hard-working people, living in the birthplace of General Motors, and the place where the great sit-down strike led to the creation of the United Auto Workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlint is also a city in crisis. Five years ago, our Republican state government used a Michigan law to take over control of the city. In 2014, the state made a fateful mistake, switching our water source to a polluted river to save a handful of dollars \u2013 causing lead contamination to leach into our drinking water, poisoning a whole community, and leading to health impacts that may haunt our children for generations. \nThe problems in Flint are not over. The water is still not safe to drink or cook with from the tap. Our infrastructure is broken, leaking, and rusting away. Our local economy, already down when the water crisis struck, struggles to rebound. And there are many more Flints across the country where environmental issues are hurting our kids and families.\nI am still sad to report that the help we need from our federal government to start to rebuild our drinking water infrastructure still sits blocked in the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress, despite the mighty efforts of our Michigan representatives, Congressman Dan Kildee, Senator Debbie Stabenow, and Senator Gary Peters.\nI am a voice for Flint, calling out for help. \nDo you know who has also heard the call from Flint? Hillary Clinton! \nShe came to Flint when the water crisis hit. She joined with our community groups, and our civic leaders, and our churches. Hillary said that, \"every single child should have the opportunity to live up to his or her God-given potential.\"\nShe said, \"I will fight for you. I will stand with you, every step of the way. I will not for one minute forget about you, or forget about your children. I will do everything I can to help you get back up, and to help you get your strength and resilience flowing through Flint again.\" \nAfter her visit in February of this year, her staff then came back to Flint, rolled up their sleeves, and got to work. With direct help from Hillary Clinton's team, we have set up the Flint WaterWorks program that is now putting the young adults of Flint into new jobs rebuilding their own community. Hillary's wonderful daughter, Chelsea, even came to Flint to bring people together to start this work and to create new opportunities for our families. \nAnd then Hillary Clinton came back to Flint, again, a month later. Hillary called out to say that lead poisoning, broken infrastructure, and struggling cities are a national crisis, not just a Flint crisis. Hillary called for getting rid of the poisons in our water, our soils, our old lead-based paint, and our cities. She made a commitment that, when she is President, she will work for a lead-free America.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat is why I'm with Her! \nSo join with Flint, and all the other Flints out there in America to get behind Hillary Clinton, to raise our voices for Hillary Clinton, and make her the next President of the United States. \nGod bless Flint and God bless America.", "Good evening. As the Mayor of Atlanta, a city that burned to the ground and rose again from the ashes; which became the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the home of the Civil Rights Movement; and because we were the \"city too busy to hate,\" we are now the economic center of the South. I am here today because I believe in our future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe we have a responsibility to one another, and to the next generation, to ensure that our opportunity is limited only by our imagination. I share this belief with Hillary Clinton: That our achievements are limited only by what we can dream and do.\nYou see, Atlanta is a city of dreamers, but when I became Mayor, our city was struggling through the worst recession in 80 years. We were broke. Crime was up. I looked around our city, and I saw that the way forward was to lean on one another, to turn to one another, and to make an agreement: That if a young woman was willing to learn, we would put a book in her hands. If a young man was willing to work, we would put a job and a paycheck in his hands. If you're willing to step up, then we will meet you half way and, together, we would put your future back in your hands.\nWe turned our city around, and at the same time President Barack Obama was turning America around. Today we are stronger, and we will grow stronger still when President Hillary Clinton builds an economy that works for everyone.\nFellow Democrats,\u00a0tonight\u00a0we choose diversity over division. We choose a steady-handed Commander-in-Chief over a loose cannon. We choose a leader who would rather be in the trenches securing healthcare for eight million children than in a suite putting his name on a tower.\nWe choose something different\u00a0tonight, because Americans are ready to get to work to make the possible real. Hillary Clinton is the leader to take us there.\nPresident Harry Truman once said there are a small number of people in America who have the power, the prestige, and the connections to make sure their interests are looked after. But for everybody else, there's the President. More than sixty years later, that still holds true.\nTonight, we have someone who will look out for all Americans, and will do so every day of her presidency, with all of her heart. Ladies and gentlemen, we have Hillary Clinton.\u00a0\nAnd now, I am honored to introduce someone who has been a friend and mentor to me during my time as Mayor.\u00a0\nMichael Bloomberg has articulated an optimistic, performance-driven vision for New York City that has also lifted up other cities around the world, thanks to his purpose-driven philanthropy.\nPlease join me in welcoming a man whose commitment to America transcends politics \u2013 the three-term Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg!", "Hello, and thank you for joining us in Philadelphia \u2014 the City of Brotherly and Sisterly Love! \nI am running for United States Senate here in Pennsylvania, and I know that, during these last few days, you've seen that Pennsylvania is great for the same reasons America is great: hard work, timeless values, and the belief that we each must look out for each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was raised here in Philadelphia, the ninth of 10 kids in a big, Irish family. My grandparents were Irish immigrants; my parents didn't have college degrees. My dad walked the beat as a police officer. \u00a0My mom worked as a restaurant hostess. But when we were growing up, none of that mattered. You see, we learned to love God and country. We learned that success isn't a product of pedigree \u2014 no, if you want to succeed, you have to give it your all, and give back.\nFor my brothers and sisters and me, this was the deal. But for so many families, this deal is off the table. Because, today, middle-class families aren't making a dime more than they were two decades ago in real terms \u2014 while costs have gone through the roof.\nHere are the facts: We have the most productive economy in the world, but the benefits of that productivity all go to the top. Top executives used to make 30 times the average guy. Now it's over 300 times. That's wrong for families and for America. \nThe truth is that fear and anxiety reach far and wide across our country. Hard-working people feel anxious and insecure. Our choice is how we respond. And this choice is on the ballot in November. \nNow, we could respond with more scapegoating and fearmongering. That's the tack of Donald Trump and my opponent Pat Toomey. Just blame the Mexicans. Blame the Muslims. Blame the government. Build a wall. For goodness sakes, the Donald even blamed the pope! My dear mother, God rest her soul, would be turning over in her grave!\nAnd you know what these guys also say: \"Hand it all over to Wall Street.\" Pat Toomey made his millions on Wall Street. And he's still selling us the same old trickle-down that benefits only the rich. Trust the stock market with your hard-earned Social Security, Toomey says. Trust the wheelers and dealers with your savings, and you will be living large, Toomey tells us.\nBut you know what? We've seen this bad movie, and the sequel. And the ending is always the same: Things work out for the big shots, and everyone else gets the bill!\nNow, we also have a different choice. We can work together. We can expand opportunity. We can build on the strength of our diversity, and the diversity of our strengths.\nMy brothers are heavy equipment operators, a printer, an X-ray certified welder. And we know a great country doesn't just buy and consume stuff. A great country makes and builds stuff. And so as Democrats, we can \u2014 and must \u2014 work for good schools, and affordable college, and job-training that enables our families and neighbors to make the economy of tomorrow. \nThis is the American way: Work hard, get ahead. This is what I will fight for in the United States Senate \u2014 and this is what Hillary Clinton will fight for in the White House.\nThank you and God bless America!", "At this hour, in some very dangerous corners of the world, young Americans stand guard. Our brave military and intelligence professionals are on the front lines, far from home, risking their lives. For us. For our freedom. For our way of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA president, a Commander-in-Chief, has no greater responsibility than the decision to send our troops into harm's way.\nI have worked alongside nine presidents, Republicans and Democrats, and I can tell you this: The only candidate for president who has the experience, temperament, and judgment to be Commander-in-Chief is Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 \nThis is no time to gamble with our future. America faces flash points and threats from around the globe. We need a president who's strong and smart, who enters the Oval Office with the respect of the generals and admirals who lead our military, with the confidence of our diplomats who represent America, and with the trust of our troops who know that she will always have their back.\nThis president is Hillary Clinton. During my time as CIA Director and Secretary of Defense, Hillary was a strong supporter of our efforts to protect our homeland, decimate al-Qaeda, and bring Osama bin Laden to justice. It was a tough decision to go after bin Laden. In long meetings in the White House Situation Room, we debated that fateful decision. I presented the intelligence to the President, laying out the risks. And when the President went around the table to the country's national security leadership, Hillary was clear: We have to go get bin Laden. And our Special Operations Forces did just that. And they sent a clear message to the world that no one attacks America and gets away with it. \nHillary is just as determined to defeat those who threaten us today: ISIS, al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, al-Shabaab. Terrorists who pervert the teachings of Islam to kill innocent people going about their daily lives, people traveling through airports in Brussels and Istanbul, families celebrating on the beachfront in France, men and women shopping in a market in Baghdad, and just this week, an 85-year-old priest whose throat was slit by terrorists who stormed his church during Mass. These murderers must be stopped.\nHillary Clinton is the only candidate who has laid out a comprehensive plan to defeat and destroy ISIS and keep America safe. She is smart. She is principled. She is tough and she is ready. Hillary is the single most experienced and prepared person who has ever run for president. \nMeanwhile, Donald Trump says he gets his foreign policy experience from watching TV and running the Miss Universe Pageant. If only it were funny. It is deadly serious. Donald Trump asks our troops to commit war crimes, endorses torture, spurns allies from Europe to Asia, suggests more countries to have nuclear weapons, and praises dictators from Saddam Hussein to Vladimir Putin.\nToday, Donald Trump once again took Russia's side. He asked the Russians to interfere in American politics. Think about that for a moment. Donald Trump is asking one of our adversaries to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts against the United States to affect our election. \nAs someone who was responsible for protecting our nation from cyberattacks, it's inconceivable to me that any presidential candidate would be this irresponsible. Donald Trump cannot become our Commander-in-Chief.\nIn an unstable world, we cannot afford unstable leadership. We cannot afford someone who believes America should withdraw from the world, threatens our international treaties, and violates our moral principles. We cannot afford an erratic finger on our nuclear weapons. \nThis is no time to roll the dice and to gamble with America's national security or with the American Dream. I've lived the American Dream. My parents were immigrants from Italy. They came through Ellis Island, made their way to California, and opened a restaurant in Monterey. I can still remember standing on a chair in the back of that restaurant washing glasses. Never could my immigrant parents have dreamed that their son would grow up to be Secretary of Defense of the most powerful military in the world.\nThe American Dream has been defended, in every generation, by the brave men and women willing to fight and die for America. They are our greatest national treasure. They deserve a serious Commander-in-Chief. If we care about them, our security, our freedoms, and the American Dream, there is only one choice: Hillary Clinton for President of the United States. \nGod bless you, and God bless our great nation.", "Good evening! I am the youngest of eight children born to migrant workers. When I told my father that I was going to join the police, he got angry. You see, he and my older brothers had been beaten by the police for no legitimate reason. But I stuck with my decision. Years later, whenever I visited, he'd show my badge off to his friends. He saw the good I was doing in my job, and he was proud of me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I am proud of my fellow officers. When my officers report for duty, they have no idea what might come up that day. \u00a0When they respond to a domestic violence call, they don't know whether a relieved victim or an abuser with a gun will answer the door. When they stop a vehicle, they have no idea whether the driver is racing to the hospital to deliver a baby or fleeing the scene of crime. They don't know whether the next 911 call will be their last. But they keep showing up. They keep answering the call. They keep putting their lives on the line. They are doing the best they can to protect our communities. We put on our badges every day to serve and protect, not to hate and discriminate.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe lost five officers in Dallas on July 7. They were gunned down as they were protecting citizens protesting the police. It has been a tough time for Dallas, Baton Rouge, and other law enforcement communities all across America who have lost officers to violence. I've been trying to make sense of it. \nViolence is not the answer. Yelling and calling each other names is not going to do it. Talking within our own group in a language only our group understands leads nowhere. We have to start listening to each other.\nMy deputies have worked hard to reach out to the communities we serve. We attend all sorts of events: Ramadan, Cinco de Mayo, Juneteenth, Pride, veterans' parades \u2013 you name it. We show up, and some of our officers are uncomfortable at first. But, the only way to serve your community is to know your community.\nLast Sunday, after working in the morning, I went in uniform to meet my partner for lunch at a nice restaurant. As I handed the server my credit card, he smiled and said that at least four tables had already offered to pay for our meal. My girlfriend and I both teared up. There wasn't a single person in that restaurant I knew. The people of Dallas knew that even though our men and women in uniform were hurting, we never stop doing our job.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlease help me to honor ALL of America's fallen officers with a moment of silence. \u00a0\nI am privileged to introduce to you some of the brave family members left behind by our fallen officers. Let's hear from them.", "I'm here tonight, in part, because my home state of Minnesota has been hit hard by tragedy. And we're not alone. Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Dallas, Texas; and Falcon Heights, Minnesota should tell us that we need a wise, compassionate, and strong leader for all Americans. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was elected to the United States Senate 16 years ago, I was seated next to the new Senator from New York, Hillary Clinton. For the next six years, I saw \u2013 up close and in person \u2013 precisely the kind of leader this country needs right now. In the Senate, Hillary was a trusted partner on both sides of the aisle. She listened to people explain their problems, not just from New York but throughout our entire country. She championed their causes, because she shared the belief of Minnesota's great Senator Paul Wellstone that we all do better when we all do better.\u00a0\nHillary Clinton has dedicated her life to serving the needs of others.\nDonald Trump, on the other hand \u2013 well, Donald Trump has dedicated his life to serving himself. He's driven small businesses into the ground by refusing to pay his bills. He's played his shareholders for suckers and ripped off hard-working, responsible Americans. At every turn in his life, he has stepped on others just to climb a little higher himself. And now he wants to step over all of us. \nBut Democrats \u2013 we're going to send him a message, aren't we? My old partner in the Senate, Hillary Clinton, will make sure of that. She has been traveling all over this country, listening and learning and offering real solutions to the problems Americans face: a 100-days jobs plan that includes the largest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, a plan to make debt-free college available to everyone, 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, and giving every four-year-old a chance to go to high-quality preschool.\nHillary Clinton will also bring her lifelong fight for universal healthcare \u2013 including the choice of a public option \u2013 to the White House. Thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, we've made a lot of progress getting people covered. But for too many families, out-of-pocket costs are still too high. Prescription drugs are still too expensive. It's time we decided once and for all that the purpose of health insurance is to give Americans the health care they need at prices they can afford, not to pad the profits of corporate America. If they won't do it, we will, and Hillary Clinton will lead the charge. \nAmerica needs a president who will pull us together and move us ahead, a president who knows we are \"Stronger Together.\" This president is Hillary Clinton. \nThe choice could not be clearer. The choice could not be more important. And that's why I am so proud to stand with all of you and to support Hillary Clinton as the next President of the United States.", "I know Hillary Clinton. I've worked alongside her. I've competed against her. \nAnd I know Tim Kaine. As governors of neighboring states, we've worked together for years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am here to tell you that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are as tough as they come. They never give up. They never give in. They never stop fighting for children and families because they know, when our families are strong, America is strong.\nNow, Donald Trump is a different story. Donald Trump doesn't fight for you. Instead, he insults people who disagree with him. He makes his followers fearful of tomorrow. He feeds off of a deep-seated and dangerous anger.\nBut anger never fed a hungry child; anger never protected a family's home or sent a kid to college. Anger never built a great Republic.\nI say to hell with Trump's American nightmare. We believe in the American Dream. \nWe believe what Hillary Clinton believes: That no American family who works hard should have to raise their children in poverty. And we believe in opportunity for all and an economy where wages go up and not down.\nBut Donald Trump? He has actually said, \"Wages are too high.\"\nAmerican wages, too high? I'll tell you what's too high: College tuition, that's too high. The cost of child care, that's too high. The number of American children who live in poverty and go to bed hungry every night, that's too high. Donald Trump's opinion of himself \u2011 way, way too high.\nAnd actually, Donald, American wages are a too low and Hillary Clinton will fight to make sure that every family who works hard can get ahead.\nOn climate change, Hillary Clinton, like you and me, believes in science. She understands climate change is not only a real threat, it is also the greatest job creation opportunity to come to the United States in a hundred years.\nDonald Trump doesn't believe in the science. He says, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese.\" I'll tell you what: If the Chinese were really capable of designing some kind of diabolical farce to hurt America, they wouldn't invent global warming. They'd invent Donald Trump.\nDonald Trump has been a bully his whole life. But here's what I learned on playgrounds in Catholic school: all bullies are cowards in disguise.\nBut unlike that immigrant-bashing, carnival barker, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton actually knows the enduring symbol of America is not a barbed wire fence. It is the Statue of Liberty!\nMy fellow Democrats \u2011 anger and fear had their moment last week. Now it's our time.\nTime to stand up for each other, stand up for our shared promise, stand up for the goodness and hope of every American heart. It's time to put Donald Trump in his place, and it's time to put a strong woman in hers \u2011 the White House!\nIt's time to elect Hillary Clinton!", "Hello Democrats!\nI'm a proud Democrat from the progressive state of California. The primary season has ended, and we have so much to be proud of. As a member of the platform committee, I have no problem with giving Bernie Sanders credit for contributing to our historic progressive platform. I am thrilled to acknowledge Secretary Hillary Clinton's work to unite and strengthen our Democratic Party. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow night, Hillary Clinton will accept the party's nomination and we must leave this convention energized and committed to winning in November. America, we have a winner in waiting! The next President of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nI am so proud to support a woman who has the skill to meet with world leaders, kings, and queens, and who commands respect from our friends and our foes alike. \nI'm elated to have a candidate who understands diplomacy, global security, and the importance of climate protection. \nI am so thankful we have Hillary Clinton, whose life of public service is not mythical but real and profound. \nHillary Clinton will have the trust of our disabled Americans. She will never mock or disrespect them. She will work to improve their lives. And she will not allow our veterans to be patronized or forgotten. \nI know Hillary Clinton will create a place at the table for all. African-Americans, Latinos, Asians, the LGBT community, Native Americans, Jews, Muslims, AMEs, Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostals. Everyone will be welcome in Hillary Clinton's White House.\nHillary Clinton is not intimidated by the NRA. Gun violence must be stopped! She will not rule with fear and predictions of failure. And while she will work to support our police, she will also support fair police policies. The lost lives of unarmed citizens must stop. Black Lives Matter!\nAnd oh yes! Women of America, women of the world, we will be treated with dignity and respect. We will not be judged by our appearance, our size, or our accent. We will not be denied freedom of choice. We will demonstrate our talents, and we will prosper. \nHillary's experience uniquely qualifies her to be the next President of the United States of America!", "Good evening, Democrats!\u00a0Philadelphia has always been a friendly place for Democrats, but I have\u00a0to say, this week, there's a little extra brotherly love \u2013 and sisterly\u00a0affection \u2013 in the air. For eight years, I was privileged to serve as the mayor of this great American city, Philadelphia. I'm proud that my administration and the host committee brought the convention to Philadelphia. I hope you've had a great time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia is my town. I grew up here. I built my career and raised my family here. And so it's with tremendous pride that \u2013 here in a city known for its history \u2013 I cast my ballot for our historic nominee: Hillary Clinton.\nNow, I've known Hillary for decades. I've known her as a champion for our cities. I've known her as a\u00a0change maker\u00a0for our citizens. And I've known her as a leader whose career has been defined by a simple creed: GSD. Get Stuff Done.\nAs a city mayor, that's what we're expected to do every day. Our neighbors hold us accountable for our problems. Complicated problems don't have simple solutions. So we need a President whose ideas \u2013 and attention span \u2013 are longer than 140 characters. Hillary Clinton is a leader who won't let complexity be the enemy of opportunity. When she sees a problem, she makes a plan and she gets stuff done. \nNow, she has a plan to make a historic investment in jobs. She has a plan to reform our broken criminal justice system. She has a plan to keep us safe from the epidemic of gun violence that is killing so many of our children \u2013 especially so many young black men \u2013 who are precious to our country and its future.\nWhat's more, Hillary's plans have details. Because details matter. Trump says he has plans. But when you're looking down at America from the top of Trump Tower, you can't see the details. Because there are none.\nAfter eight incredible years of progress under President Barack Obama, we can't afford to hand our country over to a con man who thinks the Presidency is an entry-level job on \"The Apprentice.\"\nHillary Clinton is the only competent leader in this race. She is the champion our cities need, and she will be the President our citizens and our nation deserve. \nShe gets stuff done.\nThank you.", "Kasim, thank you for that kind introduction. Let me thank all of you for welcoming an outsider here to deliver what will be an unconventional convention speech.\nNow, I'm not here as a member of any party, or to endorse any party platform. I am here for one reason, and one reason only: to explain why I believe it is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next President of the United States. And to ask you to join with me in supporting her this November.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Founding Fathers arrived here in Philadelphia to forge a new nation, they didn't come as Democrats or Republicans, or to nominate a presidential candidate. They came as patriots who feared party politics. I know how they felt. I've been a Democrat, I've been a Republican, and I eventually became an Independent because I don't believe either party has a monopoly on good ideas or strong leadership.\nWhen I enter the voting booth each time, I look at the candidate, not the party label. I have supported elected officials from both sides of the aisle. Probably not many people in this room can say that, but I know there are many watching at home who can. And now, they are carefully weighing their choices. I understand their dilemma. \nI know what it's like to have neither party fully represent my views or values. Too many Republicans wrongly blame immigrants for our problems, and they stand in the way of action on climate change and gun violence. Meanwhile, many Democrats wrongly blame the private sector for our problems, and they stand in the way of action on education reform and deficit reduction.\nThere are times when I disagree with Hillary. But whatever our disagreements may be, I've come here to say: We must put them aside for the good of our country. And we must unite around the candidate who can defeat a dangerous demagogue.\nI believe it's the duty of all American citizens to make our voices heard by voting in this election. And, if you're not yet registered to vote, go online. Do it now! It's just too important to sit this out.\nNow, we've heard a lot of talk in this campaign about needing a leader who understands business. I couldn't agree more. I've built a business, and I didn't start it with a million-dollar check from my father. Because of my success in the private sector, I had the chance to run America's largest city for 12 years, governing in the wake of its greatest tragedy.\nToday, as an Independent, an entrepreneur, and a former mayor, I believe we need a president who is a problem-solver, not a bomb-thrower; someone who can bring members of Congress together, to get big things done. And I know Hillary Clinton can do that, because I saw it firsthand!\nI was elected mayor two months after 9/11, as a Republican \u2014 and I saw how Hillary Clinton worked with Republicans in Washington to ensure that New York got the help it needed to recover and rebuild. Throughout her time in the Senate, we didn't always agree \u2014 but she always listened. And that's the kind of approach we need in Washington today, and it just has to start in the White House!\nGiven my background, I've often encouraged business leaders to run for office because many of them share that same pragmatic approach to building consensus, but not all. Most of us who have created a business know that we're only as good as the way our employees, clients, and partners view us. Most of us don't pretend that we're smart enough to make every big decision by ourselves. And most of us who have our names on the door know that we are only as good as our word, but not Donald Trump.\nThroughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off. Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business. God help us.\nI'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one! Trump says he'll punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China, but the clothes he sells are made overseas in low-wage factories. He says he wants to put Americans back to work, but he games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. He says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people, but he seems to have no problem in hiring them. What'd I miss here?!\nTruth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy. He wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. He's wrong on both counts. \nWe can only solve our biggest problems if we come together and embrace the freedoms that our Founding Fathers established right here in Philadelphia, which permitted our ancestors to create the great American exceptionalism that all of us now enjoy. Donald Trump doesn't understand that; Hillary Clinton does. And we can only create good jobs if we make smarter investments in infrastructure, and do more to support small businesses \u2014 not stiff them. Donald Trump doesn't understand that; Hillary Clinton does.\nI understand the appeal of a businessman president. But Trump's business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence in the world, and make our communities less safe.\nThe bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice. And we can't afford to make that choice!\nNow, I know Hillary Clinton is not flawless; no candidate is. But she is the right choice \u2014 and the responsible choice \u2014 in this election. No matter what you may think about her politics or her record, Hillary Clinton understands that this is not reality television; this is reality. She understands the job of president. It involves finding solutions, not pointing fingers, and offering hope, not stoking fear.\nOver the course of our country's proud history, we have faced our share of grave challenges, but we have never retreated in fear. Never. Not here in Philadelphia in 1776, not at Gettysburg in 1863, not through two World Wars and a Great Depression, not at Selma or Stonewall, and not after 9/11 \u2014 and we must not start now. \nAmerica is the greatest country on Earth \u2014 and when people vote with their feet, they come here. The presidency of the United States is the most powerful office in the world, and so I say to my fellow Independents: Your vote matters now. Your vote will determine the future of your job, your business, and our future together as a country.\nTo me, this election is not a choice between a Democrat and a Republican. It's a choice about who is better to lead our country right now: better for our economy, better for our security, better for our freedom, and better for our future. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton is the right choice this November. So tonight, as an Independent, I am asking you to join with me \u2014 not out of party loyalty, but out of love of country. And together, let's elect Hillary Clinton as the next President of the greatest country in the world, the United States of America.\nThank you.", "I was born in Detroit. For decades, I've watched our city lose tens of thousands of jobs. I'm 58 years old and the population of our city has declined every year I've been alive.\nBut that's changing now as our city's recovery is fueled by a renewed spirit of unity and a commitment to creating a comeback that includes all Detroiters. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's the idea that drives us.\nAnd it drives Hillary Clinton. Because when she looks at Detroit \u2014 and every other city in America \u2014 she sees the opportunity to create an economy in which everyone benefits. That's the kind of strong, steady leadership America needs.\nI ran for mayor of Detroit with a central message that we needed to end our historic divisions. I finished every speech the entire campaign by saying, \"We need to build a Detroit where it doesn't matter if you are black, brown, white, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, whether you're gay or straight, born in the city of Detroit or are an immigrant \u2014 everyone will be equally valued and everyone will have real opportunity.\"\nAnd that's the city that is starting to emerge.\nDetroit is 18 months out of bankruptcy, something Donald Trump knows a little bit about. But unlike Trump, Detroit is only doing bankruptcy once.\nThanks to a great partnership with President Obama, and his administration's extraordinary economic record of creating 14 million new jobs. Jobs are returning to Detroit \u2014 new auto plants and businesses are opening, Detroit's unemployment rate has been cut in half, and people are moving back.\nBut Detroit's true test is the same facing the next president: Are we creating an economy that works for everyone, or just those at the top? \nIn four nights of speeches in Cleveland, did you hear a single idea on how to do that? Did you hear any plan to protect working families? No. You heard insults and fearmongering. You heard angry, irrational rhetoric. The parroting of slogans stitched on hats.\nCompare that to what you've heard \u2014 and what you are going to hear \u2014 from Hillary Clinton.\nCreating good-paying jobs by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, and offering tax credits to companies that create real job training through new apprenticeships. She wants to make college debt-free, and she wants to reward companies that share profits with their employees.\nBecause Hillary Clinton knows the best way to bring our cities back is to give our citizens a real chance at good-paying jobs. That's why I want to help her become the next President of the United States.\nAnd I want you to help too! So, get out there. Register your friends. Volunteer.\nAnd this November, cast your vote for Hillary Clinton!\nThank you!", "I am honored to stand before you as a proud member of the progressive California delegation. I'm also very happy to acknowledge my D'Alesandro Maryland roots. It is a privilege to stand before you as the Leader of the House Democrats \u2013 a caucus honored to serve with our partner Sen. Harry Reid and our friend Vice President Joe Biden; a caucus honored to serve with one of the greatest Presidents in our history, President Barack Obama! Together we passed the Affordable Care Act, which would not have been possible without the courage of the House Democrats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a caucus proud that we look like 21st-century America; more than 50 percent women, people of color, and LGBT Members. What a contrast with the narrow and restricted club that met in convention in Cleveland last week. Our convention is different, and so is our mission.\nWe come to public service and to this convention not to trumpet darkness, but to light a way forward for our country.\nWe come here conscious that we are approaching a milestone moment in the American journey \u2013 the election of the first woman President of the United States.\nHillary Clinton knows that this moment is not just about one woman's achievement. It's about what electing a woman President will mean for achieving the dreams and hopes and aspirations of every woman, every daughter, every son, and every family, all across our land, for generations to come.\nThis moment is about the landmark progress President Hillary Clinton will achieve for families everywhere yearning for a better life, a better chance, in a better America. Hillary Clinton has a vision rooted in deeply held values. She has a genuine strength that differs profoundly from her opponent's bluster. She has a gift for strategic thinking, seasoned by knowledge and experience. And she has a connection to hard-working American families forged in her lifetime of leadership and service to others.\nLeadership and public service are our cause and our calling as Democrats. Here is our commitment to the American people, for a stronger America. First, secure our nation with strong action to keep Americans safe, fighting terror at home and abroad, and eliminating ISIS. We must be strong and smart, not reckless and rash. \nAt home, safer communities demand courage, not cowardice, in the face of the NRA. For the sake of the 91 Americans who are killed by gun violence each day, we must break the grip of the gun lobby on Congress and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists. If you're on the no-fly list, then you belong on the no-buy list. That is why Democrats, led by Congressman John Lewis, held our historic 26-hour sit-in in the Capitol. And we won't stop until Congress heeds the will of the American people and disarms hate. \nSecond, secure our future \u2013 by investing in education, innovation, and opportunity. Our imperative is to create more good jobs and a living wage, with equal pay and paid leave for everyone, so that every family can earn their dreams \u2013 buy a home, send their children to college, retire with dignity \u2013 and never have to worry that their Social Security will be privatized or Medicare's guarantee will be taken away. And our imperative is quality health care that builds on the Affordable Care Act \u2013 which now covers 20 million more Americans.\nThird, secure our democracy by removing barriers to voting and draining the poisonous swamp of secret money in our politics. We Democrats believe the future of America should be decided by the voices of the voters, not the pocketbooks of the powerful.\nNot far from here, our Founders pledged their lives, their liberty, and their sacred honor to create a democracy. A government of the many, not a government of the money. So Hillary Clinton and Democrats in the House and Senate are sworn to free our democracy by overturning Citizens United. Then \u2013 and only then \u2013 can we make America truly fair. \nAnd only then can we have fairness in a budget that is a statement of our values, that invests in the future, creates jobs, reduces the deficit, and ensures that everyone is paying their fair share.\nWe know what is on the line in what truly is the most important election of our lifetime: for the future of the Supreme Court, for the fate of a planet imperiled by climate change, for the sake of immigration reform, for the promise of an America that rewards hard work instead of those who exploit America's workers, for women's reproductive rights, equal rights, civil rights, and to do what is right for our service members, veterans and military families who have given so much for our country.\nWe will stand and speak and campaign for Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine. And I tell you this: They will win in November. We will fight to restore Democratic majorities in the Senate and the House, and I tell you this: We can do it.\nAre you ready to work for a great Democratic victory? Are you ready to make history, electing Hillary Clinton President of the United States? I thought so. Onward to victory!\nGod bless you. God bless our men and women in uniform. God bless America.", "I'm a state representative, an organizer, and a proud citizen of the White Earth Nation of Ojibwe. \nI'm also a mom.

So I wrote her this letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Siobhan,\nPolitics isn't always fun. Sometimes you run into some pretty mean people who don't like you for simply being you.\nLike that \"naughty guy\" Donald Trump on TV. The one who says all those nasty things about women \u2014 and about Native Americans like us. I'm so sorry you have to hear that, my girl. Your name is not Pocahontas. It is Siobhan Ma'iingan, and you should never let anyone make you feel anything less than proud of who you are. \nBecause despite everything that has happened to our people, and no matter what Donald Trump says, we are still here. And I want you to grow up with our people's values: honoring our elders, showing gratitude to our warriors, cherishing our children as gifts from the Creator. \nI also want you to grow up knowing that our President shares those values, too.\nThat's why we have that Hillary sign out on our lawn. We can trust her to keep our women safe, keep our veterans well-cared-for, and keep the promises the United States has made to our tribes.\nMost importantly, Hillary knows that our children are sacred. Back before you were born, Hillary worked at a place called the Children's Defense Fund \u2013 yup, just like your mommy \u2013 helping to make sure kids with disabilities could go to good schools just like everyone else.\nAnd then, also just like your mommy, she decided to run for office. And the bullies did not like that at all.\nBut Hillary didn't let them stop her. She never lets bullies like Donald Trump stop her. And neither should you.\nNow, you can't run to be the first Native American President until you're 35. But you can come knock on doors with me for Hillary this fall. And I'll be so, so proud to bring you with me to vote for her on November 8th. Someday, I'll vote for you.\nLove,\nMommy", "Good evening, Democrats! I am thrilled to join you here in Philadelphia. It's my honor to serve as the youngest member in the Tennessee General Assembly, representing the \"Fighting 26\" Tennessee House Democratic Caucus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy fellow young people, we have a choice, and it's crystal clear! What side of history do we want to be on? Which political leader will we allow to define our generation? Will we raise our voice and demand a leader who will fight for debt-free college for all and make community college free, a leader who will help people loaded down with crippling student loan debt, a leader who will push new strategies to combat the problems people in our generation face? Will you join me and support a leader who understands that the deep racial wounds of our country have not yet healed, but together we can work to be the change we wish to see in the world?\nWill you stand with a leader who has defined her life by helping the least among us \u2013 from going down to segregated Alabama as a law student, to working with the Children's Defense Fund, to fighting for healthcare for children across this nation, to standing up for women everywhere and proclaiming before the world that \"Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights.\" \nThe stakes are too high, the consequences too severe. In Cleveland last week, the RNC nominated a man who has built his campaign on words that divide us and walls that divide us and approved a party platform that enshrines intolerance. Whether you're a Republican, Democrat, or Independent; whether you're black, white, Latino, or Asian; gay, straight, or transgender; whether you run a ranch, a farm, a church, or a beauty shop down in Memphis \u2013 Secretary Clinton is a fighter for us all. \nThese next few months won't be easy. But when has fighting for what's right ever been easy? Working together, we are stronger and more powerful than we ever dare dream. So stand up! Go back to your cities and states! And make sure Secretary Hillary Clinton is the next President of the United States of America.", "My fellow Democrats, I met Tim Kaine during his first campaign for Richmond City Council.\nI saw in him what I still see in him now: a person of substance, passion, principle, and integrity. A great convener, who brings people together. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven as he's risen from city hall to the governor's mansion to the U.S. Capitol, I still see in Tim the same sense of purpose \u2013 the fundamental goodness \u2013 that led him to become a civil rights lawyer: listening to his neighbors' concerns and fears, fighting for the underserved and unrepresented, and finding solutions to make his community better and more fair.\nThe Bible calls on us to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly. There are few people who live that creed as fully and as completely as Tim Kaine.\nSo it's my great honor to place into nomination for the Office of Vice President of the United States of America, my friend, the gentleman from Virginia, Tim Kaine!\nMadam Chair, I move to suspend the rules and nominate by acclamation Tim Kaine as the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate.", "My name is Ruben Kihuen. I am the proud son of a housekeeper and a former farmworker.\nMy family emigrated from Mexico when I was 8 years old. My parents knew if we worked hard, sacrificed, and played by the rules, in America, we would succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 23 years, my mother has cleaned hotel rooms in Las Vegas, working tirelessly, without complaint, to provide for her family. In America, she got a decent wage, health care, and the protection of a union \u2013 Culinary Local 226. \nIn America, her youngest son had the opportunity to learn English in public schools, play soccer in public parks, and work his way through an affordable public university.\nToday, that 8-year-old is standing here as a State Senator and a candidate for U.S. Congress. \nThat is the beauty of America.\nDonald Trump and Republicans tell a different story about immigrant families. To them, we are \"rapists\" and \"criminals.\" They believe in building walls and pitting Americans against each other.\nDonald Trump fears us \u2013 worse, he incites that fear in others. He must be terrified of me, a Mexican immigrant running for Congress.\nThe truth Donald Trump doesn't want you to know is this: Todos somos so\u00f1adores \u2013 we are all DREAMers.\nWe dream of more than citizenship. \nWe, like all Americans, dream of a good education, a good-paying job, to own our own car, our own home, that our kids will breathe clean air, and grow up on safe streets.\nWe dream of an economy that works for everyone \u2013 with a living wage, affordable health care, a secure retirement, and debt-free college.\nWe dream of our daughters knowing in their heart they, too, can be President of the United States.\nTodos somos so\u00f1adores \u2013 we are all DREAMers.\nHillary Clinton has spent her entire life fighting for our dreams.\nDemocrats, it's our time!\nTime to reject the fears of Trump, time to take back Congress, time to elect Hillary Clinton, and time to turn our dreams into reality!\nThank you!", "Last week, a speaker at the Republican convention called equality a \"distraction.\" \"Who cares?\" he asked. Well, I care. My husband Randy and our three children care. These LGBT leaders standing with me care. The authors of our nation's Declaration of Independence, signed right here in Philadelphia, cared. Americans at Seneca Falls, Selma, and Stonewall \u2013 they cared. And Hillary Clinton cares, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 26, 2015, I was walking past the Supreme Court. A crowd was gathered, awaiting the Court's marriage decision. The news hit like a\u00a0thunderclap. Some wept. Then, spontaneously, hundreds joined together to sing\u00a0our\u00a0national anthem. I called Randy. I could barely speak. You see, Randy and I have been together for 24\u00a0years, 23 of them raising kids.\nOur family is different, but we read bedtime stories the same,\u00a0tie shoes,\u00a0and check homework the same. We\u00a0dream and comfort\u00a0the same. But until that day, we weren't the same, not in the eyes of the law. So, as I listened to\u00a0our national\u00a0anthem, I realized that our family, our\u00a0love was\u00a0no longer less than. We were now equal.\nIt's a beautiful thing when your\u00a0country\u00a0catches up to you. When your basic rights and your very family are on the line, it matters what happens in those\u00a0beautiful\u00a0buildings with marble columns. It matters who's leading our country. It matters if they care.\nAmerica, we have a choice. Donald Trump doesn't care about some families. He's against marriage equality. He wants to go back.\u00a0When I first met Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire 24 years ago, I was nobody. I was some queer kid sleeping on a couch. I was scared to death that who I was meant that no one would ever care about me. \nHere was this woman, about to be First Lady. She cared. Over the last 24 years she has kept on caring about me, my husband, and our kids. Hillary Clinton cares about all of our families. And that's why we must all care about this election. \nNow, I want to introduce Sarah McBride. Sarah is a courageous young leader, and the first trans person ever to address a national convention. Sarah, it's an honor to\u00a0make history\u00a0with you, because we are Stronger Together.", "Hello Democrats! Hello Texas!\nI'm a breast cancer survivor, and I know that there are many in this room, who faced what I faced \u2014 who fought the fear, and survived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats, we must fight the Republican nominees of fear, and unite behind Hillary Clinton \u2014 the candidate who fights for us.\nI came here from Houston, a city with a great new mayor and a place where people of all races, religions, and sexual orientations are respected. We have a strong legacy: Mickey Leland, and Barbara Jordan \u2014 who addressed the 1976 Democratic Convention. Her pursuit of justice and equality is our call today. Barbara Jordan once said, \"Through the process of amendment, interpretation, and court decision, I have finally been included in 'We, the People.'\"\nDemocrats, we are the \"We the People\" party!\nLast night, we reached a milestone of history. We nominated the first woman to be the President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton \u2014 a woman of uncommon strength, a change-maker, a survivor. I am woman! Hear me roar!\nBut on the other hand, we have the Republican nominee, the man of fear; and Cleveland, the convention of fear. But we cannot choose fear.\nWe cannot elect a president who provides no hope to the laid-off union worker, no hope for the mother of five, and no hope for the researcher who might find a cure for cancer. We cannot elect a leader who is willfully ignorant to the outcry of young people who want real criminal justice reform, and real responsible gun safety legislation now.\nNot another Newtown, Charleston, Orlando, Baton Rouge, or Dallas.\nThe Republican nominees of fear are not for our America. So, Democrats, we must be determined in our fight, demanding of each other, discerning of the facts, and demonstrative of our movement. The universe is dark, but there are bright, bright, bright stars that light the way and they will guide us to a safer, more prosperous, more equitable America. The winds of change are at our backs, Clinton and Kaine, and we must march on, march on.\nAnd together, elect Hillary Clinton.\nSo stand up Democrats! Stand up and see those stars! Stand up and see the light!", "It's an honor to be in the birthplace of our democracy this evening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI grew up in Mansfield, Ohio. My dad was the town doctor. I never saw him turn a patient away. He didn't see profit margins, he saw people who needed help. My mother, who grew up in Mansfield, Georgia, raised three Eagle Scouts. She taught each of us to fight for justice. My wife, Connie, grew up in Ashtabula, Ohio. Her father worked at the electric plant and was a proud member of Utility Workers Local 270. Her mother was a nurse's aide and hospice homecare worker. They wore their bodies out working long days so their children could go to college.\nFor too many Americans today, that same hard work isn't paying off. People work longer hours and produce more. But while corporate profits have gone up, workers' wages haven't kept pace.\nHillary Clinton knows that a job is not just a paycheck. It's about building a better life for your family. She's a progressive who gets things done. And she has a real plan to give American workers the chance to share in the profits they create.\nDonald Trump believes \"wages are too high\" \u2013 those are his words. Too high? And he wants to be President? How do you help Americans build better lives for their families when you outsource jobs? This suit I'm wearing? Made by union workers ten miles from my Cleveland home in Brooklyn, Ohio. Trump suits? Made in Mexico. Trump glassware? Made in Europe \u2013 not Toledo, America's glass city. Trump furniture? Made in Turkey, not Archbold, Ohio. Donald Trump's hat may be stamped with \"Make America Great Again,\" but his ties are stamped \"Made in China.\"\nI've been fighting for a trade agenda for more than 20 years that puts American workers first. And I can tell you, in all those years, I've never even seen Donald Trump. No \u2013 the only thing I've seen Donald Trump do when it comes to U.S. trade policy is run his mouth and line his pockets. While Trump outsources jobs, Hillary Clinton has a real plan to bring jobs back to America \u2013 like $10 billion in \"Made in America\" tax credits to revitalize manufacturing. Trump proposes tax cuts, too: $3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his. Of course we can't say for sure how much Trump will take for himself because he's refused to share his tax returns with the American people. \nThe one thing we know for sure is, Donald Trump looks out only for Donald Trump, no matter who he steps on along the way. Just ask the Friel family. They had a cabinetmaking business based here in Philadelphia \u2013 that is, until they signed a contract with Trump Plaza. They finished their work, but Trump refused to pay them what they were owed, starting a downward spiral that ended in bankruptcy. They'd spent nearly five decades in business, providing jobs and livelihoods to workers and families. It all came crashing down after a contract with Donald Trump.\nTrump says he wants to run our country like one of his businesses. I guess that means he wants to slap his name on it, make false promises, and then scam innocent people out of their savings.\nLook, there's no question we've got work to do. We face serious challenges today. Too many families struggle just to get by, let alone get ahead. Donald Trump thinks people in states like mine will choose his counterfeit campaign over the genuine solutions we're fighting for tonight. He is wrong. Donald Trump looks at towns in the middle of America and sees a \"rust belt\" of decay.\nWell, we reject the term \"rust belt.\" Hillary, my friend Tim Kaine, and I see vibrant and innovative communities throughout the industrial heartland: Cleveland is pioneering the country's first freshwater wind farm. Youngstown is leading the way in advanced manufacturing. And that power plant where Connie's father worked? It isn't rusting. It's been converted to a water processing plant, supporting hundreds and hundreds of Ohio jobs. That's how we rebuild a thriving American middle class.\nThose are the kinds of solutions Hillary Clinton will deliver, solutions that make a real difference in people's lives. And that's why Hillary will win Ohio \u2013 and as everyone in this hall knows, as Ohio goes, so goes the nation.\nIn this hall on Tuesday, Connie and I were overtaken with emotion when our longtime friend Bernie Sanders moved to nominate Hillary Clinton to lead our party on to victory in November. It took me back to Mansfield, Ohio, when I was a third grader at Brinkerhoff Elementary School. I remember looking up at the poster on the wall of our American Presidents. Other than a few mustaches and powdered wigs, they all looked pretty much like me. \nMy two granddaughters and three grandsons are too young to appreciate the historic nature of this moment. But when they go to school and look up at those same presidential posters in their classrooms, they won't see faces that look only like mine. They'll see Barack Obama. And because of the work we do over the next hundred days, my granddaughters will see themselves in the face of President Hillary Clinton.", "Twelve years ago, I was copiloting a Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq. A rocket-propelled grenade ripped through our cockpit, and I'm here tonight because of the miracles that followed. Some I can explain, like the bravery of my crew, determined not to leave me behind. Some I can't, like the shrapnel from the explosion passing through the spinning rotor blades without destroying them, allowing us to land.\n\nWhat I do know is that I started that day doing what I loved. I ended it knocked down. Surviving only because my buddies refused to leave me and wouldn't stop, even as they struggled to carry my body, with its missing limbs. Eleven days later, I woke up with a debt I can never repay. And I still wake up every morning trying to be worthy of them and their struggle, of this miraculous second chance.\n\nMy family and I had been knocked down before. My dad, a proud Marine, lost his job in his fifties. For a time, Dad did odd jobs; Mom took in sewing; I got a minimum-wage job. We relied on food stamps to help us get by. The summer before I started college, my parents walked everywhere instead of taking the bus. Once a week, they would hand over $10 to the university housing office, a deposit so I could move into the dorms in the fall.\n\nThanks to Pell Grants, work study, affordable student loans, and lots of waitressing, I fulfilled my dream of college. I worked hard, but I had a lot of help from my community and country. And my story is not unique.\n\nIt's a story about why this is the greatest nation on earth, a nation that so many are willing to die defending. A nation that says if you keep working hard, we won't abandon you.\n\nOf course, in Donald Trump's America, if you get knocked down, you stay down. By the way, Donald Trump, I didn't put my life on the line to defend our democracy so you could invite Russia to interfere in it. You are not fit to be Commander-in-Chief.\n\nMy fellow Americans: We can choose a different path.\n\nTen years after my helicopter was shot down, almost to the day, I got my most important job: I became a mom. We named our little girl after Abigail Adams, who urged her husband to \"remember the ladies\" as he and his colleagues first declared our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \u2014 just a few miles from this very spot.\n\nMy Abigail already knows women can fly helicopters in combat. And in 102 days, when we elect Hillary, my daughter's first memories of a President will be of a woman.\n\nDemocrats, tonight, let's go forward with confidence and pride in who we are and what we believe. We're Democrats because we stand up for the most vulnerable among us. We embrace the notion that lifting one another up doesn't cost nearly as much as leaving other Americans behind. We stand up for immigrants and people with disabilities. And we defend the basic values that have made, and will keep, America the greatest country in the world.\n\nMay God bless you. May God bless our troops. And may God bless the United States of America.", "In 2008, before I came to Congress, my wife, Jill, and I got to meet Hillary Clinton.\nMore importantly, our two daughters, Gabby and Serena, got to meet her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were 12 years old. They showed Hillary these cute dolls of theirs \u2013 dolls that wore shirts that read: \"One day, a girl will be President.\"\nThat wasn't just a dream of my daughters, it was a dream of my mother. \nShe passed away in December.\nIn one of our last conversations, she talked about how excited she was to live to see a woman president.\nAnd, at 91, she knew what her granddaughters knew at 12: Electing Hillary Clinton isn't about making history. It's about creating the future. \nIt's not about electing a woman. It's about electing THIS woman \u2013 who will create opportunity for all of us.\nThat opportunity is what my dad fought for when he served in World War II and earned a Purple Heart at the Battle of the Bulge.\nIt's what I'm fighting for when I serve the great people of South Florida, including so many members of the Greatest Generation.\nNow, we all have to fight for the only candidate who will protect the Social Security and Medicare our seniors have earned and not slash it.\nGet unlimited money out of politics and not encourage it.\nAlways stand by Israel and the Jewish community and not offend it.\nAnd stand up to the NRA and never coddle it.\nWe have to start fighting, right now.\nTo find out how you can help, text \"FL\" to 47246!\nWe have to vote this November \u2013 AND October.\nIf you're lucky enough to live in a state like Florida that lets you vote early or vote by mail, do it!\nWhen Hillary Clinton met my daughters, she signed her name on the shirts their dolls were wearing.\nThis year, my daughters are old enough to vote in their first presidential election. \nWhen they look at their ballots, they'll see that same name: Hillary Clinton.\nAnd they'll proudly mark the box next to it. \nThis OCTOBER, my daughters will cast their first EARLY votes for America's first woman President.\nAnd as their dad, like so many parents, I couldn't be prouder of my kids, of our candidate, and of our country.", "I wasn't born in America, but every day, I serve it. \nAs a Colonel in the Air Force Reserves, a Member of Congress, and an immigrant whose parents chose this country, I care deeply about who serves as our Commander-in-Chief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI look forward to January 20, when that woman is Hillary Clinton.\nBut you don't have to serve in Congress or wear a uniform to insist that the person we entrust with the security of our country, the lives of our troops, and our nuclear launch codes has a steady hand. \nAll you have to do is be a voter.\nThe scariest part of Donald Trump's acceptance speech wasn't the apocalyptic America he says he sees.\nIt's that he said, \"I alone can fix it.\"\nEvery commander I've met in the military knows that they can't do it alone, or be brash, or make stuff up. \nBecause when you ignore facts, people will die. \nHillary Clinton knows that each of us and all of our elements of national power make us strong:\nSmart diplomacy. A powerful economy. Educated children. \nWe are Stronger Together.\nDonald Trump said \u2013 and I am not making this up \u2013 \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do.\"\nPlease welcome the general who knows more about ISIS than anyone, the President's former Special Envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, retired Marine Gen. John Allen.", "Thank you. Welcome everyone. \u00a0\nI want to thank my beautiful wife Anne and my three wonderful children, Nat, Woody, and Annella. Nat deployed with his Marine battalion two days ago to protect and defend the very NATO allies that Donald Trump now says he would abandon. \u00a0Semper Fi, Nat! My parents and in-laws are here, our siblings and their spouses, our nieces and nephews, hundreds of friends from Virginia and beyond, including my great friend, Representative Bobby Scott. We love you all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, for my wife Anne and every strong woman in this country; for Nat, Woody, and Annella, and every young person starting out in life to make their own dreams real; for every man and woman serving in our military, at home and abroad; for every family working hard to get ahead and stay ahead; for my parents and in-laws and every senior citizen who hopes for a dignified retirement with health care and research to end diseases like Alzheimer's; for every person who wants America to be a beloved community, where people aren't demeaned because of who they are, but rather respected for their contributions to this nation; for all of us who know the brightest future for our country is the one we build together; and for my friend Hillary Clinton, I humbly accept my party's nomination to be Vice President of the United States.\nI never expected to be here. But let me tell you how it happened.\nI was born in Minnesota and grew up in Kansas City. My folks weren't much into politics. My dad ran a union ironworking shop. My mom was his best salesman. My brothers and I pitched in to help during summers and on weekends. That's how small family businesses work. My parents, Al and Kathy, taught me about hard work, and about kindness, and, most importantly, faith.\nI went to a Jesuit boys school \u2013 Rockhurst High School. The motto of our school was \"men for others.\" That's where my faith became vital, a North Star for orienting my life. And I knew that I wanted to fight for social justice.\nThat's why I took a year off law school to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. I taught kids welding and carpentry. Aprend\u00ed los valores del pueblo \u2013 fe, familia, y trabajo. Faith, family, and work. Los mismos valores de la comunidad Latina aqu\u00ed en nuestro pais. Somos Americanos todos.\nAnd here's what really struck me. I got a first-hand look at a system \u2013 a dictatorship \u2013 where a few people at the top had all the power and everyone else got left out. It convinced me that we've got to advance opportunity for everyone. No matter where they come from, how much money they have, what they look like, how they worship, or who they love.\nBack in 1970, in Virginia, the Republican Governor Linwood Holton believed exactly the same thing. He integrated Virginia's public schools, so black and white kids would finally learn together, and the family enrolled their own kids, including his daughter, Anne, in those integrated inner-city schools. \nWhen Anne went off to college, she brought with her the lessons borne of that experience. And one day, in a study group, she met this goofy guy who had been off teaching kids in Honduras. Anne and I have now been married for almost 32 years, and I am the luckiest husband in the world.\nAnne's parents, Lin and Jinks, are here today, 90-plus and going strong. Lin's still a Republican. But he's voting for a lot of Democrats these days. Because any party that would nominate Donald Trump for president has moved too far away from his party of Lincoln. And if any of you are looking for that party of Lincoln, we've got a home for you right here in the Democratic Party.\nLin's example helped inspire me to work as a civil rights lawyer. Over 17 years, I took on banks and landlords, real estate firms and local governments, anyone who treated people unfairly \u2013 like the insurance company that was discriminating against minority neighborhoods all across America in issuing homeowners' insurance. \nThese are the battles I've been fighting my whole life. And that's the story of how I decided to run for office. My city of Richmond was divided and discouraged. An epidemic of gun violence overwhelmed our low income neighborhoods. People were pointing fingers and casting blame instead of finding answers. I couldn't stand it. So I ran for city council.\nI won that first race, more than 20 years ago, by 94 votes. And I've said ever since \u2013 if I'm good at anything, it's because I started at the local level, listening to people, learning about their lives and trying to get results. Later, I became Mayor of Richmond, Lieutenant Governor, and then the 70th Governor of Virginia. I was a hard times Governor \u2013 steering my state through the deepest recession since the 1930's. But tough times don't last \u2013 tough people do. And Virginians are tough. Smart, too.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe achieved national recognition for our work \u2013 best managed state, best state for business, best state for a child to be raised, low unemployment, high family income. We shed tears in the days after a horrible mass shooting at Virginia Tech, but we rolled up our sleeves, and fixed a loophole in our background check system to make us safer. And we invested in our people \u2013 expanding pre-K and higher education, because education was the key to all we wanted to be.\nNow I have the honor of serving in the Senate. I work on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees to keep us safe at home and strong in the world. I work on the Budget Committee with Bernie Sanders, a great leader, fighting for investments in education, health care, research, and transportation. And I serve on the Aging Committee, making sure that seniors have a secure retirement and don't get targeted by rip-off artists who will scam them out of their savings or overcharge them for prescription drugs. And here's a funny thing: I spend time with a lot of Republican Senators who, once they've made sure nobody's listening, will tell you how fantastic a Senator Hillary Clinton was. \nMy journey has convinced me that God has created a rich tapestry in this country \u2013 an incredible cultural diversity that succeeds when we embrace everyone in love and battle back against the dark forces of division. We're all neighbors and we must love our neighbors as ourselves.\nHillary Clinton and I are compa\u00f1eros del alma. We share this belief: Do all the good you can. Serve one another. That's what I'm about. That's what you're about. That's what Bernie Sanders is about. That's what Joe Biden is about. That's what Barack and Michelle Obama are about. And that's what Hillary Clinton is about.\nNow, last week in Cleveland, we heard a lot about trust. So let's talk about trust. I want to tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton.\nFirst, she's consistent. She has battled to put kids and families first since she was a teenager \u2013 in good times and bad, in victory and defeat, in and out of office, through hell or high water. Fighting for underprivileged kids at the Children's Defense Fund. Fighting to get health insurance for 8 million kids when she was First Lady. Fighting for the well-being of women and girls around the world. \nHere's a little tip for you: When you want to know about the character of someone in public life, look to see if they have a passion, one that began before they were in office, and that they have consistently held on to throughout their career. Hillary's passion is kids and families. Donald Trump has a passion too: It's himself. \nAnd it's not just words with Hillary, it's accomplishments. She delivers. As Senator, after 9/11, she battled Congressional Republicans to care for the first responders who saved victims of that terrorist attack. As Secretary of State, she implemented tough sanctions against Iran to pave the way for a diplomatic breakthrough that curtailed a dangerous nuclear weapons program. She stood up against thugs and dictators and was a key part of the Obama national security team that decided to go to the ends of the earth to wipe out Osama bin Laden.\nHey, remember Karla, the little girl we heard from on Monday who feared her parents would be deported? She trusts Hillary to keep them together. And remember the Mothers of the Movement we heard from last night? They trust Hillary to keep other mothers' sons and daughters safe. \nAnd as he's serving our nation abroad, I trust Hillary Clinton with our son's life. \nYou know who I don't trust? Donald Trump. The guy promises a lot. But you might have noticed, he has a habit of saying the same two words right after he makes his biggest promises. You guys know the words I mean? \"Believe me.\"\nIt's gonna be great \u2013 believe me! We're gonna build a wall and make Mexico pay for it \u2013 believe me! We're gonna destroy ISIS so fast \u2013 believe me! There's nothing suspicious in my tax returns \u2013 believe me! By the way, does anyone here believe that Donald Trump's been paying his fair share of taxes? Do you believe he ought to release those tax returns like every other presidential candidate in modern history? Of course he should. Donald, what are you hiding?\nAnd yet he still says, \"Believe me.\" \"Believe me?\" Here's the thing. Most people, when they run for President, they don't just say \"believe me.\" They respect you enough to tell you how they will get things done.\nFor example, you can go to HillaryClinton.com right now and find out exactly how she'll make the biggest investment in new jobs in generations, and how she'll defend and build on Wall Street reform. You can see how she'll reform our immigration system and create a path to citizenship, and how she'll make it possible to graduate from college debt-free. You can see how she'll guarantee equal pay for women and make paid family leave a reality. With just one click we can see how she'll do it, how she'll pay for it and how we'll benefit.\nNot Donald Trump. He never tells you how he's going to do any of the things he says he's going to do. He just says, \"believe me.\" So here's the question. \u00a0Do you really believe him? Donald Trump's whole career says you better not.\nSmall contractors \u2013 companies just like my dad's \u2013 believed him when he said that he'd pay them to build a casino in Atlantic City. They did the work, hung the drywall, poured the concrete. \u00a0But a year after opening, Trump filed for bankruptcy. He walked away with millions. \u00a0They got pennies on the dollar. Some of them went out of business. All because they believed Donald Trump. \nRetirees and families in Florida believed Donald Trump when he said he'd build them condos. \u00a0They paid their deposits, but the condos were never built. He just pocketed their money, and walked away. They lost tens of thousands of dollars, all because they believed Donald Trump. Charity after charity believed Donald Trump when he said he would contribute to them. And thousands of Trump University students believed Donald Trump when he said he would help them succeed. They got stiffed.\nHe says \"believe me.\" Well, his creditors, his contractors, his laid-off employees, his ripped-off students did just that. Folks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. Our nation is too great to put it in the hands of a slick-talking, empty-promising, self-promoting, one man wrecking crew.\nDon't take it from me. Take it from former First Lady Barbara Bush. She said she didn't know how any woman could vote for him after his offensive comments. Or John McCain's former economic advisor \u2013 who estimates Trump's promises\u00a0would cost America 3.5 million jobs. Or the independent analysts that found\u00a0Trump's tax plan, a gift to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up\u00a0$30 trillion\u00a0in debt.\nOr John Kasich, the Republican Governor who had the honor of hosting the Republican Convention in Cleveland but wouldn't even attend it because he thinks Trump is such a moral disaster. Or take it from the guy who co-wrote Trump's autobiography. For Trump, he said, \"lying is second nature to him.\" So, do you believe him? Does anybody here believe him?\nThe next President will face many challenges. We better elect the candidate who's proven she can be trusted with the job. The candidate who's proven she's ready for the job. And, by the way, I use the word \"ready\" for a specific reason. When I lived in Honduras, I learned that the best compliment you could give someone was to say they were \"listo\"\u2013 ready. \u00a0\nNot \"inteligente\"\u2013 smart. \u00a0Not \"amable\"\u2013 friendly. \u00a0Not \"rico\" \u2013 rich. \u00a0But \"listo.\" Because what \"listo\" means in Spanish is prepared, battle-tested, rock-solid, up for anything, never backing down. And Hillary Clinton is \"lista.\"\nShe's ready because of her faith. She's ready because of her heart. She's ready because of her experience. She's ready because she knows in America we are stronger together. My fellow Democrats, this week we begin the next chapter in our proud story.\u00a0\u00a0\nThomas declared all men equal, and Abigail remembered the women. Woodrow brokered peace, and Eleanor broke down barriers. Jack told us what to ask, and Lyndon answered the call. Martin had a dream, Cesar y Dolores said si se puede, and Harvey gave his life. Bill bridged a century, and Barack gave us hope. \nAnd now Hillary is ready. Ready to fight, ready to win, ready to lead. Thank you, Philadelphia. God bless you all.", "As Governor of Pennsylvania, it has been an honor to host you here in Philadelphia this week. Two years ago, I ran for Governor on the fundamental belief that society can only succeed when we build prosperity, and share it broadly. But this wasn't a lesson I learned in politics. It was a lesson I learned in business. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter serving in the Peace Corps and earning a Ph.D. from M.I.T., I surprised my family and friends by coming home to Central Pennsylvania to work in the family business, a building materials company where I started out driving a forklift. Eventually, we became\u00a0one of the\u00a0largest suppliers\u00a0of kitchen cabinets in North America. \nOne of the keys to our success was that we recognized that in business, you are only as good as the people you have in your company, and thus, you had to treat everyone like they mattered. Because, the truth is, they do. Now, I understand that not all businesspeople see it this way. When we contracted with a vendor, we paid them. \nDonald Trump? He stiffed hundreds of small businesses, from plumbers to painters, ruining their companies as he sought to enrich himself. At our company, like at many others across the country, we treated our female employees with respect. When they had kids, we celebrated them, and gave them paid leave. Donald Trump said that pregnant workers are an \"inconvenience,\" so it's no surprise that he has put forward no plan for paid family leave. \nFinally, as our company grew, another important part of our business model was that we had a profit-sharing plan. We knew our employees contributed to our growth. So, in addition to good wages and benefits, we shared between 20 and 30 percent of the company's profits directly with them. \nFor 2013, a turnaround year, our company had\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0workers\u00a0who\u00a0received\u00a0an average of $5,000 each that could be put toward college tuition, a well-earned vacation, or anything else they wanted to spend it on. \u00a0Donald Trump? He runs businesses so that they only help \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Donald Trump. \nIn his six bankruptcy filings, he used the process to protect himself and even enrich himself while his employees were left out of luck. We didn't do what we did because we were looking for awards. We did it because it was the right thing to do for our workers. We did because it was great for my company's bottom line. \nIt was smart business, plain and simple. We were a\u00a0stronger, more successful business because we were all in it\u00a0together. Hillary Clinton believes that too. \nThat's why, as president, Hillary Clinton will reward companies that share profits with employees, not just executives. Under her proposal, companies will get tax credits worth 15 percent of the profits\u00a0they share\u00a0with their employees.\u00a0The credits would last for two years and would be larger for small businesses. Because Hillary believes that if you work hard, you should share in your company's success!\nShe also will fight to raise the minimum wage, ensure equal pay for women, and guarantee up to 12 weeks of paid family leave, plus affordable childcare. That's fair, it's smart, and it's\u00a0great\u00a0for our economy because it's good for workers\u00a0and\u00a0it's good for business.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt this moment, when we need to restore the fundamental American idea that if you work hard, you can get ahead and stay there, we need a president who recognizes that an economy that doesn't work for everyone, doesn't work\u00a0at all. We need a president who believes that our society can only succeed when economic prosperity is shared broadly.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe need Hillary Clinton!", "Good evening! Buenas noches! Thank you! And how about we thank all the volunteers, the police officers, and security; the workers who set up, cleaned up, and fed us \u2013 who've made this convention a success.\n\nAnyone here an immigrant or the child or grandchild of immigrants? Anyone the first in your family to go to college? \n\nWho here makes a living working with your hands, making this country better? This is what a GREAT America looks like. So when I hear someone say, \"America isn't great,\" it hits me, like when someone says, \"your father was just a ditch digger; your mother wasn't even born here.\"\n\nThis election is about us. It's personal. It's about telling every little boy and every little girl: You can grow up to be the President of the United States. When she was 18, my mom came from Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. She was the boss. She juggled her jobs at home and as a clerical worker. \n\nMy father, he had to leave school by the sixth grade to help support the family. I remember: He would leave for work long before my three sisters and I would get up for school. When you work in the fields, and in construction, you rise with the sun. In winter, when Sacramento turned cold and rainy, and the construction jobs disappeared, my dad would somehow find other work \u2013 laying a tile floor, canning tomatoes, or hauling someone's trash. \n\nMy parents didn't go to college, but they encouraged us \u2013 and like so many of you, I became the first in my family to graduate with a four-year degree. I know that education opens doors. \n\nHillary Clinton gets that. She understands that every child deserves a great education, no matter their zip code. As First Lady of Arkansas, Hillary had what she called the Chelsea test. If a school wasn't good enough for her daughter, it wasn't good enough for anyone's child. That's why as President, she'll bring preschool to every four-year-old in America. She'll rebuild our crumbling schools. She'll give our teachers the support and tools they need, and the pay they deserve.\n\nHow many of you have student debt? Hillary will fight for debt-free college tuition, because nobody should be priced out of college. And she'll ensure folks can refinance their student loans, because nobody should be held down by the crush of student debt.\n\nI recently went with Carolina my wife to witness our youngest daughter Natalia graduate from high school. Natalia knows the sky's the limit. Hillary wants for all children what we give to our children. Hillary wants to build schools \u2013 Donald Trump wants to build walls. His idea of an education plan \u2013 Trump University.\n\nHe once demanded that President Obama release his college transcripts because it would be, \"very revealing.\"\n\nI think it would be \"very revealing\" for Donald Trump to release his college transcript. Who here thinks he did as well as he says he did?\n\nAt every stage in his life, Donald Trump has exploited America's laws to put himself first. He uses lawsuits the way my mom uses coupons to drive down prices. He uses bankruptcies \u2013 six of them \u2013 like a wealthy man's get-out-jail-free card. I can't tell you if this man has ever had a callous on his hands. Does he know the price of a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread? And why won't he release his tax returns? What is he hiding? Why won't he show the American people who he is?\n\nLet me tell you who Hillary Clinton is. A few months ago, Hillary came to my city of Los Angeles and sat down with people like my parents: grandmothers, DREAMers, and men who work all day in the sun, yet remain in the shadows. As the meeting ended, the crowd swelled around her. She took every photo requested with families who had never been anywhere close to a future President. People who couldn't even vote. She embraced them and consoled them \u2013 and she listened to them. It's those moments that make this election personal, that define a President.\n\nThe Hillary I've known for 24 years is someone who has always listened to those who have been silenced. Our next Vice-President Tim Kaine nos escucha tambi\u00e9n \u2013 \"he listens to us too.\"\n\nWe've come a long way from the days when my dad couldn't walk into a restaurant because of signs that read, \"No dogs or Mexicans allowed.\" Now is not the time to turn back. There's a saying in Spanish \u2013 Dime con qui\u00e9n andas y te dir\u00e9 qui\u00e9n eres \u2013 \"Tell me with whom you walk and I'll tell you who you are.\" Hillary Clinton has walked with us all her life.\n\nNo matter who we are, or where we come from, or what we look like, or how much money we have, or who we love, Hillary Clinton walks with us. So, now, the question is: Are we going to walk with her? Are we going to fight for a nation where love trumps hate? Are we going to build an America that's Stronger Together? \n\nThen, together, let's elect the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton!", "Please hold the hands of the persons next to you! Let us pray:\nO God of many names, we know that You call us to work hard to bring people together. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo build bridges of hope for the future, we reach out to our neighbors, no matter their race, creed, sexual orientation, or color. We hold hands together for healing the pain and grief from violence and death. We allow Your love, Gracious God, to overcome our fears as we learn to respect the \"other\" and to treat the most vulnerable of our society just as we do our friends. Help us to become the loving children You want us to be!\nWe ask You to open our minds to discern the complex issues of our communities, our nation, and our world. Open our hearts to Your Spirit and to Your teaching to love our neighbors as ourselves. Help us to open our doors with radical hospitality to all our neighbors, seeking both conversations and actions as we work together to end discrimination in all forms and to solve our communities' problems. \nLord, You have spoken through Your many prophets and teachers throughout history. They have taught us that we must not demonize individuals, groups, or peoples of other faiths as a response to perceived threats. They have challenged us to tear down walls of fear and hatred so that we can be stronger together. They have called us to love others as we love You and to treat others as we wish to be treated. \nAs we hold hands right now, we are reminded that together, we can transform the world for good.\nLord God, give us the courage to leave this place with determination and fortitude to move onward and upward to become a better nation, one that can solve our many problems TOGETHER, not apart. Help all of the world to see our nation as a shining lamp on a hill. \nGreat God of the Universe, may we, as the founder of Methodism taught, \"Do all the good we can. By all the means we can. In all the ways we can. In all the places we can. At all the times we can. To all the people we can. As long as ever we can.\" \nAMEN.", "Thank you. I\u2019m honored to be here.\n\nAs some of you know, we end every episode of Duck Dynasty with a family prayer at the dinner table. So tonight, I want to start with a prayer: \u201cFather-God, bless our time here tonight. Let everything we say and do be pleasing and acceptable to you, and please bless our country.\u201dI\u2019ve always said that I have three things in common with Mr. Trump. We\u2019re both successful businessmen. We\u2019ve both had hit TV shows. And we both have intelligent wives who are MUCH better looking than we are.\nIt\u2019s been a ROUGH year for the media experts.\u00a0 It must be humbling to be \u00a0so\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wrong about so much for so long.\n\nBut I have a theory about why they missed the Trump Train: they don\u2019t hang out with regular folks like us who hunt, fish, pray and actually work for a\u00a0living.\nHeck, they don\u2019t even know how to talk to people from middle America.\u00a0 You\u00a0\u00a0 tell them you\u2019re from Louisiana and they usually start talking REALLY SLOW AND REALLY LOUD.\nLet me tell you why I\u2019ve been on the Trump Train from the beginning. When you grow up in the South with rednecks, there are some occasional\u2026 disagreements. Disagreements sometimes turn into\u2026 fisticuffs. But anytime I was ever in a bad spot, I always knew my brothers would have my back.\nToday\u2026 in a lot of ways\u2026 America is in a bad spot. We need a president who will have our back.I can promise you this: no matter who you are, DONALD TRUMP WILL\u00a0 HAVE YOUR BACK.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a job\u2026 or trying to grow a business\u2026 DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.\nIf you\u2019re a serviceman fighting overseas\u2026 or a cop keeping us safe at home\u2026 DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.\nIf you\u2019re an average American who feels like you\u2019ve been forgotten\u2026 neglected by far away leaders\u2026 that the deck is stacked against you and you just can\u2019t\u00a0 win\u2026 DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.\nHe may not always tell you what you want to hear\u2026 you may not always agree\u2026 and it may not always be politically correct. (But when your dad is Phil Robertson, you get used to that sort of thing.)\nBut Donald Trump will always \u2013 always \u2013 tell you the truth as he sees\u00a0 it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why we can trust him to make America great again as our next president.\n\nThank you, and God bless you.\n\n", "In 2006, Anita and I had the pleasure of touring a Naval base in San\u00a0 Diego.\n\nOur guide that day happened to be a Navy SEAL recovering from combat- related injuries.\n\nHe was a Texas boy\u2026 plainspoken and respectful\u2026 and his love for America came through loud and clear.\nAs we parted ways that day, we told him if you\u2019re ever in Austin, come on\u00a0by.\n\nNow, some might call that meeting blind chance or a twist of fate\u2026 but I call it the grace of God.We kept in touch over the years\u2026 through a tour in Iraq and his return to Texas\u2026 until one day, he showed up on our doorstep\u2026 unannounced\u2026 with nowhere else to turn.We welcomed him into our home\u2026 helped him get the care he needed\u2026 and today, he\u2019s like a second son.Many know about the battles he fought in Afghanistan\u2026 but few know about the battles that he\u2026 and thousands of veterans like him\u2026 face when they come\u00a0 home.Tonight, our commitment is this: Making America great again starts by\u00a0 taking\n\ncare of our veterans.\u00a0Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome an American hero\u2026 the Lone Survivor\u2026 Marcus Luttrell.\n\n", "Thank you governor, and thank you for having me. Serving my country and her people both on the field of battle and here at home has been my greatest honor.\n\nTonight I can\u2019t speak on behalf of all veterans, but what I can do is speak of my own experience and share first hand knowledge.\nI grew up around a number of Vietnam veterans. Their country asked them to serve, and they did their duty. But they came home to hate, ridicule and judgment.\n\nBut something interesting happened as a result. Those veterans and millions of their fellow citizens raised their sons and daughters to never treat our soldiers like that again.\n\nMy dad served in Vietnam and raised me to be patriotic, to love my country, to respect those who protect Her.\nAnd those are the values I see in America today.\u00a0 We respect our veterans,\u00a0\u00a0 and we know we have to take care of them. That\u2019s what they were promised, and that\u2019s what they deserve.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to help veterans is to let them choose their own doctor so they can get care when they need it.\u00a0I\u00a0appreciate that Donald Trump supports this idea. It\u2019s a great idea whose time has come.\n\nIt says a lot about this generation of Americans, that even when our government doesn\u2019t take care of its own, the citizens stand up and form foundations to help the wounded and families of the fallen. Thank you for that, from the bottom of my heart.\n\nAmericans know that each of us has a duty, and we\u2019re ready to do it.\n\nEvery one of us has to step up in some way. We need leaders to step up in government\u2026 citizens to step up and hold leaders accountable\u2026 and some will have to step up and answer the call of service.\n\nWhether that means fighting on a foreign field of battle like I did, or protecting and serving on our own city streets\u2026 everyone who keeps America safe deserves our respect.\n\nAs a military man, I don\u2019t really like to talk too much about politics. My philosophy is, just give me the mission and me and my team will go get it done.\n\nBut I will say this: In the United States military we don\u2019t leave anyone behind, and neither should our next commander-in-chief.\nAs president, Donald Trump will proudly stand with our veterans and police, and so will I, because that\u2019s the only way we will make America safe again.\n\nThank you and God bless you.\n\n", "Thank you for the kind welcome. Aren\u2019t we blessed to have such brave heroes protecting us like Retired Lt. Col. Charles Kettles, who just this morning received the Medal of Honor for his heroism in Vietnam?\n\nI want to thank Mr. Trump for asking me to be here tonight. What an honor it is to talk about a man I trust with the lives of my family and the health of our\u00a0country\n\u2026 America \u2026 the greatest country God created.\n\nAmerica is an easy place to get to. But \u2014 for you first time voters \u2014 it\u2019s important to know what it means to be an American.\nIt doesn\u2019t mean getting free stuff.\n\nIt means sacrificing, winning, losing, failing,\u00a0succeeding.\n\nSometimes doing things you don\u2019t want to do, including the hard work \u2026 in order to get where you want to be.\nThat\u2019s what being an American means.\n\nBut our country is in a bad spot right now. You can feel it and see it everywhere.\nThere\u2019s no stability, nothing seems right.\n\nAll the things we hold dear are being attacked every day.\n\nWe cannot go down this road anymore. We need to stop!! We need Donald Trumpto fix this.\n\nIs he a messiah? No, he\u2019s just a man. A man who wants to give back to his country \u2026 America.\nThe country that has given him everything. A country that has given us all so much.\nNow it\u2019s time to give back to her.\n\nWe have a choice in November.\n\nWe can go for Hillary Clinton: who wants to continue the same policies that are wrecking this country.\nPolicies that make us unsafe.\n\nA woman who somehow feels entitled to the presidency \u2026 that she is somehow owed it.\n\nOr we can go for Donald Trump: A man doing this from the goodness of his heart and genuinely wants to help.\nA man who knows how to get things done \u2026and a man who says what he means and means what he says.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to be president for her.\n\nDonald Trump wants to be President for us.\n\nSo, let\u2019s make not just make America great again \u2026 let\u2019s make America \u2026 America again!\nThank you and God Bless you.\n\n", "My name is Patricia Smith.\n\nMy son Sean was one of four brave Americans killed during the 2012 terrorist attack at Benghazi.\nSean was a wonderful son and father to my two amazing grandchildren, Samantha and Nathan, now 10 and 11.\nHe was proud to serve his country with the United States Foreign Service.\u00a0 The last time I talked to Sean, the night before the terrorist attack, he told me, \u201cMom, I am going to die.\u201d\n\nAll security had been pulled from the embassy, he explained. And when he asked why, he never received a response.\nNobody listened. Nobody seemed to care.\n\nThe very next day, he was murdered by radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nTo this day, I don\u2019t even know why a computer guy like Sean was sent to Benghazi.That night, we lost sons, brothers, fathers, and\u00a0husbands.\n\nWe lost four brave Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country they chose to serve.And, the American people lost the truth.\n\nFor all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of the cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has wrought upon America, I blame Hillary Clinton.\n\nI blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son.\n\nIn an email to her daughter shortly after the attack, Hillary Clinton blamed it on\u00a0terrorism.\n\nBut when I saw Hillary Clinton at Sean\u2019s coffin ceremony, just days later, she looked me squarely in the eye and told me a video was\u00a0responsible.\n\nSince then, I have repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton to explain to me the real reason why my son is dead.\nI\u2019m still waiting.\n\nWhenever I called the State Department, no one would speak to me because they say I am \u201cnot a member of the immediate family.\u201d\n\nSean is my SON.\n\nHillary Clinton is a woman, a mother and a grandmother of two. I am a woman, a mother and a grandmother of two.\nHow could she do this to me? How could she do this to any American family?Donald Trump is everything Hillary Clinton is not.\nHe is blunt, direct, and strong.\n\nHe speaks his mind, and his heart.\n\nAnd, when it comes to the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism, he will not hesitate to kill the terrorists who threaten American lives.\n\nHe will make America stronger, not weaker. This entire campaign comes down to\u00a0 a single question.If Hillary Clinton\u2026 can\u2019t give us the TRUTH\u2026 why should we give HER the presidency\n\n", "OZ \u2013 Thank you America for showing us the support and dedication that should have been offered by Hillary and her State Department to those who saved their butts.\n\nTIG \u2013 September 11, 2012, at approximately 9:35 pm, we got a call that the consulate was under attack. We immediately grabbed our weapons and armed up. We were ready to go. But on three separate occasions, we were told to wait, and the Chief of base told us to STAND DOWN!\n\nWe heard State Department Security scream over the radio, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get here now, we are all going to DIE!\u201d They were under siege. Stand-down orders be dammed.\u00a0 We went.\n\nPulling up to the consulate, we saw fire and smoke pouring out of the Ambassador\u2019s residence. I saw one of the State department security officers pulling Sean Smith\u2019s lifeless body from the building. He was dead. We moved into the building looking for the Ambassador. The heat from the fire blasted our faces. The smoke obliterated our sight. We crawled on our bellies to stay under\u00a0it.\nTanto and DB came through the back gate and made their way onto the consulate grounds. After several minutes, Tanto helped State gather sensitive material and prepared them to leave in their armored vehicle.\n\nSuddenly, we started receiving small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades from the back gate.\u00a0 I made my way to the roof to get a better firing position.\u00a0 As\u00a0 I moved up to the edge of the building, I saw one of the terrorists come out from behind the wall into the driveway.\n\nHe fired an RPG, reloaded, and fired again.\n\nOn his third attempt, I hit him with a 10 round volley, killing him. But there were more where he came from. We had information that 100 terrorists were getting ready to mount another counter-assault. We didn\u2019t know if the Ambassador was\u00a0 still at the Consulate, but we had reason to believe he was dead. We were responsible for 30 other people. We had to make a decision. We decided to head back to the Annex.\n\nOZ \u2013 As the team arrived back at the annex, we took up fighting positions. We knew the terrorists were headed our way.We were ready for them!! We saw movement on the east side of our compound. Something with sparks trailing it flew over the wall and landed between Tig and me.\n\nIt exploded. So, we unleashed hell.\n\nThere were about twenty terrorists in the first wave. They went away with a whole lot less.\nTIG \u2013 After that first attack, Oz grabbed his med kit and pulled out medical gauze.\u00a0 He stuffed it in his ears.\nI looked at him, smiled and asked, \u201cWas it loud much?\u201d OZ \u2013\u00a0 My ears felt like they had exploded.\nTig was firing next to my left ear.\n\nSoon we got word that the Support team from Tripoli led by Glen Doherty had landed at the Benghazi airport. You think security at our airports is bad\u2026Try landing at an airport controlled by a local militia with a bunch of guns and a bag of money.\n\nThank goodness money talks!\n\nTIG \u2013 Around 1:30 am, the Ambassador was still missing. We saw movement again on our eastern perimeter. We called Bob and asked if anyone was coming to secure the perimeter.\u00a0 He said \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAt that point, a vehicle came out of the darkness. A guy jumped out and drew his arm back like he was about to throw something.\nOz saw this and put three rounds into him, dropping him like a sack of potatoes. Another guy took his place.\nThen another. And another.\n\nOZ \u2013\u00a0 It was like whack-a-mole.\n\nOne would pop his head up shooting, and we\u2019d knock him off. Someone would take his place, and we\u2019d shoot him.\n\nTIG \u2013 Then, we got a call saying the Ambassador was at the hospital in Benghazi.There was no way to determine if this was valid or if he was alive or dead. We thought it could have been a trick to get us to come out of our defensive positions and split up.So we decided to stay put.\n\nOZ \u2013 Up on the roof, Rone told me that if if weren\u2019t for Tig, he would have died back at the compound.\nWe also talked about our kids and how many of us here in Benghazi had young children.\nHeck, Jack had just found out that his wife was\u00a0 pregnant.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know if we would see them again.\n\nMorning approached. It was that time when the black sky starts turning blue and you could hear the morning prayer over the loud speakers. We knew the next attack was coming. Over the radio, we heard Glen and the Tripoli team were on their way.\nWhen Glen arrived, he joined us on the roof.\n\nI was sure glad to have another gun fighter.\n\nThe attack started with a rocket propelled grenade and small arms fire from the north.\n\nThen a mortar hit the top of our outer wall.\n\nThe state Department Security guy yelled out he was hit. We opened fire.\n\nA second mortar hit the top of the roof to my right by about 15 feet. The explosion knocked me back.\n\nAs I got up, I noticed Rone in a fetal position at my feet.\n\nI went to grab my rifle with my left hand and noticed it was hanging at a right angle.\n\nA third mortar hit the roof. Glen fell face down.\n\nHe was out of the fight.\n\nI tried again to get my arm to work, it wouldn\u2019t. The fourth mortar hit.\n\nIt felt like I was stung by a thousand bees.\u00a0 I dove for cover and everything went quiet.\n\nI pulled out a tourniquet from my med kit to put on my arm. But I got distracted and reached over to Rone and to check for a pulse.\nThere wasn\u2019t one.\n\nI looked up and saw Tig climbing onto the roof.\n\nThe dust and debris of war continued to fall around us.\n\nTIG \u2013 As I came over the top of the wall, I saw that the State Department security officer was in bad shape.\n\nHis left arm was hanging at a right angle like Oz\u2019s arm, and his left leg was almost severed about six inches above the ankle.\n\nI put tourniquets on both the arm and the leg. I then moved over to the next sound I heard. It was Oz whining like a girl.\n\nHe was playing with his injured arm. I told told him to quit playing with it. OZ \u2013\u00a0 Hey I was trying to get it to work.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t stay in place.\n\nTIG \u2013 I grabbed the tourniquet that Oz had started to put on, got it in place, and helped him stand up.\n\nI asked him if he could get to the ladder by himself.\n\nOZ \u2013\u00a0 I told him hell yes.\n\nI knew Tig needed to check on Glen and Rone. I was hoping they were still alive.\n\nI sat on the edge of the ledge looking at the ladder and trying to figure how I was going to climb down.\n\nI survived several attacks on the annex, but wouldn\u2019t it be my luck to fall off this\u00a0darn roof and break my neck? Yea that\u2019s the story I want my kids to\u00a0hear.\n\nI hooked my good arm around the top rung of the ladder and swung my body to try to land my feet on the first rung.\nMy feet missed.\n\nI pulled myself up with my good arm and climbed down. Once inside the building, I laid down on the floor.\nI knew I had other injuries that needed to be treated.\n\nI told them to cut my clothes off, and that\u2019s when they found another 20-30 shrapnel holes.\n\nTIG \u2013\u00a0 After I got Oz over to the ladder, I went over to Rone.\u00a0 I rolled him\u00a0 over.\n\nI pulled his body armor off and checked for vitals. I checked his pupils.\n\nNo sign of life.\n\nI said a prayer over him. Next I went over to Glen.\n\nI checked his vitals and pupil dilation. No response.\n\nNo sign of life.\n\nI also said a prayer over Glen.\n\nI picked up their gear and weapons. We knew it was time to move. We had to get everyone out.\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t defend against indirect fire.\n\nOZ \u2013 We stabilized the wounded, secured the dead, and made sure we left no critical information behind.\n\nThe militia that escorted us to the airport were Gaddafi\u00a0 loyalists.\n\nUpon arrival, we loaded up the non-shooting personnel. I was in the back of a pickup truck.\n\nPeople came over to carry me on the plane. I sat up and brushed \u2019em off.\n\nI said, \u201cI walked into Benghazi. I\u2019m walking out.\u201d\n\nTIG \u2013 That plane was the same plane that brought Glen and the guys from Tripoli down to Benghazi. This time, Glen wasn\u2019t on it.\nThis was a plane that was secured by the Tripoli team from a local Libyan, they had just met that day.\n\nWe got everyone loaded up and headed to Tripoli.\n\nWe turned to the task of getting the ambassador\u2019s body from the hospital. The Gaddafi loyalist commander volunteered to get him.\nOnce he returned with the Ambassador, we checked to verify his identity and his condition.\n\nHe was in the same clothes I saw him wearing that morning on September 11th. There were no signs of torture or mutilation.\nHe died of smoke inhalation.\n\nAt that point, we didn\u2019t know how we were going to get out of Benghazi. Out of the blue, a C130 transport aircraft landed.\nIt taxied over, did a u-turn and stopped.\n\nOne of the Tripoli team members went over with a translator and persuaded the pilots to take us to Tripoli.\nThe last American to leave Benghazi left, not on an American plane, but on\u00a0a\n\nLibyan plane flown by Libyan pilots.\n\nThe first U.S. aircraft to arrive in Libya was not a military jet but a medical transport bird that arrived at approximately 5 pm on the evening of September 12th, after the siege was over.\n\nOZ \u2013 More than 30 American lives were saved that night. It\u2019s because Americans never give up.We refuse to lose.\n\nBenghazi is not about politics. It\u2019s about opportunities.\n\nOpportunities taken when we defied stand down orders and opportunities squandered when Hillary Clinton failed to protect her people on the ground. Had she done her job, we would not have had to compromise the annex.\n\nTy, Glen, Sean, and Ambassador Stevens would be alive today. Now we as Americans have the opportunity to elect someone who will make this country safe again.\n\nSomeone who will have our backs. Someone who will bring our guys home.\n\nSomeone who will lead with strength and integrity. That someone is Donald Trump.\n\nTIG \u2013 We did our part. Now do yours. Thank you.\n\n", "Good evening.\n\nI\u2019m honored to be here.\n\nI know I am not your typical convention speaker.\n\nYou might be wondering why I chose to speak. The truth is that I\u2019ve never considered myself very political or spoken out politically before.\nBut my belief in this country and my faith in Jesus Christ have compelled me to speak now.\n\nI\u2019m concerned about our country\u2019s future. I\u2019m concerned about my children\u2019s future.\n\nAnd I believe we need Donald Trump, who shares my beliefs and my faith, to get our country back on track.\n\nIn the past eight years, failed policies have caused our country to deteriorate. Our rights have been trampled and our security threatened.\n\nWe are weaker by almost every measure. We are on the wrong path.\n\nIt is clear even to someone who was not born here. I came to the United Statesfrom Rome in 1985.\n\nI followed all the rules and finally became a naturalized citizen in 1996. Others who want to come to the U.S.\u00a0to live and work should follow the same rules. We are a nation of laws for a reason.\n\nThere should be no shortcuts for those who don\u2019t want to pay\u2026or\u00a0 wait.\n\nMy mother was born in communist Prague, escaped the Czech Republic and met my dad in Italy.\n\nI know what socialism looks like. I don\u2019t want that for my children.\n\nBut that\u2019s the path we\u2019re headed down with the leader we\u2019ve had\u2026and the candidate he endorses.\n\nBarack Obama and Hillary Clinton promote division\u2026 don\u2019t be fooled\u2026 butDonald Trump is for unity.\n\nDonald Trump believes in one America, with liberty and justice for all. Having secure borders, protecting our citizens\u2026 none of this is hateful. This is the responsibility of the government\u2026 and the right thing to do.\n\nDonald Trump will get it done and put us back on the right track. People know this, and that\u2019s why they have voted as they have. We can no longer afford to be silent.\n\nOur country needs Donald Trump to make us great again. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.\n\n", "Good evening. I am Michael McCaul, Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.\nI am a fourth-generation Texan, born and raised in Dallas.\n\nLet us remember tonight the Dallas, and Louisiana, police officers who tragically lost their lives.\nAmerica stands with my hometown, and we will NEVER forget.\n\nAnd to law enforcement officers across this nation, we are with you and we willalways support you.\n\nTonight we just heard powerful testimony from people who have been\u00a0devastated\u00a0by Obama\u2019s reckless immigration policies.\n\nHaven\u2019t we had ENOUGH?\n\nAnd now Hillary Clinton is promising more of the same \u2013 open borders, executive amnesty, and the surge of Syrian refugees.\n\nThis is a dangerous\u2026 liberal agenda\u2026 and it\u2019s time for a change. It\u2019s time to take back our country and make America SAFE\u00a0 again!\n\nWe need to end sanctuary cities\u2026keep dangerous people out of our country\u2026and SECURE our borders.\nOur country\u2019s national security is at risk.\n\nRonald Reagan once reminded us that America was \u201ca shining city upon a hill\u201d\u2026a beacon of hope to all the world.\n\nBut after eight years of weak leadership, our \u201ccity on a hill\u201d is now a city\u2026 under siege.\n\nToday our allies no longer trust us, our adversaries no longer fear us, and our enemies are plotting against us.\n\nThis did not happen by accident, it happened by design.\n\nIt is the work of Barack Obama\u2026 and the architect of his failed foreign policy,Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor years they presided over America\u2019s retreat. And the consequence is clear:\n\nleading from behind\u2026 has led us into danger.\n\nWhen Hillary stopped talking about the \u201cwar on terror,\u201d our enemies noticed\u2026\n\nWhen she helped withdraw our forces from Iraq, creating a power vacuum, she paved the way for ISIS to rear its ugly head\u2026 and our enemies\u00a0 noticed\u2026\n\nWhen four Americans were murdered\u2026 and Benghazi burned, she blamed it on a video\u2026 and our enemies noticed\u2026\n\nAnd when she stood on the sidelines while terror hotspots erupted across the globe, our enemies noticed\u2026\n\nWe have all witnessed the recent attacks in Nice, Paris, Brussels and Istanbul\u2026but now we are in the crosshairs.\n\nOur own city streets have become the battleground: Fort Hood.Boston.Chattanooga.\nSan Bernardino and Orlando.\n\nInstead of protecting Americans, the Obama Administration turned a blind eye to the danger.So let\u2019s cut through the suffocating political correctness and call the threat what it really is\u2026 radical Islam.\nThese fanatics have radicalized a religion into a weapon, and they are targeting our way of life.\n\nPresident Reagan once asked, \u201cAre you better off than you were four years\u00a0ago?\u201d\n\nBut tonight let me ask you this question: are you SAFER than you were eight years ago?\nIs our military stronger?\n\nIs America still respected?\n\nOver and over again, Obama and Hillary apologized for America\u2026 and allowed jihadists to spread like wildfire.\n\nWe CANNOT afford Hillary in the White House\u00a0again.\n\nWe NEED someone who can repair the damage she has done, take the fight to the enemy, and put America first.\n\nThat man is Donald Trump.\n\nI am proud to serve as a member of his national security team, and I can tell you this:\nDonald will NEVER apologize for American greatness\u2026 he will promote it.\n\nHe will NEVER bow down to our enemies\u2026 he will stand up to\u00a0them.\n\nAnd Donald will NEVER allow terrorists to gain ground against America \u2026he willshake the ground they walk on.\n\nMy father was a bombardier in World War II and participated in the D-Day invasion against the Nazis.\nHis generation \u2013 the greatest \u2013 defeated fascism and communism, handing down a better and safer America to my generation.\n\nNow, we are in a struggle against the forces of radical Islam and terror, which must be defeated for our children and grandchildren.\n\nA Trump Administration will take on this fight and send a clear message to the Islamist terrorists:\u00a0you may have fired the first shot, but rest assured, Americawill fire the\u00a0last.\n\nThank you, and may God bless America.\n\n", "Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to make something very clear: Blue Lives Matter!\n\nI want to talk with you about something important, indeed, a concept that five law enforcement officers were murdered and nine more were wounded for earlier this month in Dallas, and for which three more were murdered yesterday inBaton Rouge: that is the importance of Making America Safe Again.\n\nI believe that this noble mission is not just a requirement, but a prerequisite for achieving this campaign\u2019s goal of Making America Great Again.\nWe simply cannot be great if we do not feel safe in our homes, on our streets, and in our communities.\n\nI see this every day, at street level where many Americans increasingly have an uneasiness about the ability of their families to live safely in these troubling times. This transcends race, religion, ethnicity, gender, age, and\u00a0lifestyle.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe it, a recent Gallup poll confirms it: more than half of all Americans now worry a great deal about crime and violence, up consistently and dramatically from just a few years ago.\n\nFor African-Americans that number is 70 percent.\n\nSadly for a growing number of communities the sense of safety that many of us once took for granted has been shattered.\nAmericans don\u2019t always feel safe no matter if they are working in a big city, living in a suburb or\u00a0 rural areas all around our great country.\n\nI often tell residents of Milwaukee, and the cities and towns I visit that safety is a shared endeavor. It starts with the willing acceptance of people to play by society\u2019s rules: a code we collectively agree upon that ensures stability, order, fairness, and respect.\n\nIt\u2019s built on a foundation of trust in each other and in the people who administer and enforce society\u2019s rules, which at its foundation is the rule of law.\n\nIn 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote passionately about \u201cthe interrelatedness of all communities and states\u201d and about our \u201cinescapable network of mu-tu- ALITY, tying us in a single garment of destiny.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of the basic morality of the rule of law, provided that it is applied\u00a0equally to both the wealthy and the impoverished; both men and women, and yes, the majority and the minority.\n\nWhat we witnessed in Ferguson, in Baltimore, and in Baton Rouge was a collapse of social order. So many of the actions of the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter transcend peaceful protest, and violates the code of conduct we rely\u00a0on.\n\nAmerican law enforcement officers understand that race is and has been a heated issue in our country. Most appreciate the vital need for thoroughness and transparency in pursuit of the greater good in their actions, and in their investigations.\n\nThese are truths that are self-evident to me, and which I practice, and they are the truths that Donald Trump understands and supports.\u00a0Donald Trump is the steadfast leader our nation needs.\n\nHe has spoken passionately to me of his belief in our American system of justice, and he speaks to the values that are at the foundation of our social\u00a0contract.\n\nThroughout his campaign and over many years before he has consistently and\n\nconstantly raised his voice not only in defense of the character of the American police officer, but the need for ALL people to feel they are being treated fairly and respectfully by law enforcement.\n\nDonald Trump understands that what can make our nation safe again is a recommitment to a system of justice in which no government official, not even\u00a0 those who have fought their way to the marble and granite halls of Washington; no private citizen, not even Hillary Clinton; and no group of people, despite the fervor with which they press forward their grievances, can claim privilege above the law.\n\nThe tradition of the primacy of the rule of law in America is strong. It is in those simple facts and in our acts that we will move forward and toward Making America Safe Again. God Bless you, and may God continue to bless these United States\u00a0of America.\n\n", "For eight years, we\u2019ve seen what happens when America leads from behind. Leading from behind that\u2019s not what the Army taught me. To everyone who agrees that America should lead the way, let me say loud and clear: help is on the\u00a0way.\n\nLet me tell you a story about an Arkansas farm boy. When America was at war, he was in school and then in a comfortable job. But he sacrificed that comfort, against the wishes of his father, who himself had served. He volunteered for the Army. He became an infantryman.That farm boy was my dad. He went toVietnam in\u00a01969.\n\nThirty-five years later, I did the same. Against the wishes of my family, I gave\u00a0 up my legal career and I volunteered for the Army. I became an infantryman. I went to Iraq and Afghanistan. My dad said he felt like God was punishing him for what he did to his dad.\n\nBut God wasn\u2019t punishing them; God had called us to serve. Just as He calls so many of you.\n\nMy family isn\u2019t extraordinary; in fact, we\u2019re very ordinary. From farms in Arkansasto fire stations in New York, many families could tell the same story. The defense of this country is a family affair.\n\nWe don\u2019t fight because we hate our enemies, but because we love our country. We love its freedom. We love that we\u2019re born equal and live free, that no one rules without consent.\n\nWe know these things are worth fighting and dying for because they make life worth living for.\n\nOur warriors and their families don\u2019t ask for much. But there are a few things we\u2019d like.\n\nA commander-in-chief who speaks of winning wars and not merely ending wars, calls the enemy by its name, and draws red lines carefully, but enforces them ruthlessly.\n\nAnd politicians who treat our common defense as the chief responsibility of our federal government, not just another government program.\n\nThis isn\u2019t much to ask for, but eight years without it is more than enough. So I\u00a0say again: In a Trump-Pence administration and with a Republican Congress, help is on the way.\n\nNo man wants more war if he\u2019s planned memorial services for fallen comrades, carried their flag-draped caskets off a plane, and buried them at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nBut as Washington said: \u201cTo be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of our common defense, after all, is to protect our people so that we can enjoy the blessings of peacefaith, freedom, family, prosperity.\n\nMy father and his father were willing to fight so that their children and grandchildren might live in peace. That wasn\u2019t to be. But my generation is willing to fight so that our children might live in peace.\n\nAnd for that cause, I speak tonight not only to Republicans, but to the millions of Independents and Democrats who share that dream and who wish to make America safe again.\n\nThank you, and God bless you.\n\n", "I\u2019m here tonight as a determined American who loves our country. And my message to you is very clear: WAKE UP AMERICA! There is no substitute for American leadership and exceptionalism. America should not fear our enemies\u2026\n\nIn fact, we should clearly define our enemies\u2026face them head-on\u2026and then defeat those that seek to threaten our country and our way of life\u2026.\n\nTonight, we stand together as proud patriots\u2026who deeply love our country and believe in the principles of freedom, democracy and liberty.\nWe know that America, our nation, is the greatest country in the history of the world.\n\nLet there never be a substitute for America and let us sustain the\u00a0conviction\n\nthat our country holds a unique place and role in history \u2013 American exceptionalism must never fade.\n\nBut now, it is up to us\u2026and you cannot sit this election out.\n\nI stand with you as a citizen, a veteran, a patriot but more important, as an American\u2026 to tell you that the destructive pattern of putting the interests of other nations ahead of our own will end when Donald Trump is President.\n\nFrom this day forward, we must stand, tougher and stronger together, with an unrelenting goal to not draw redlines and then retreat\u2026and to never be satisfied with reckless rhetoric from an Obama clone like Hillary\u00a0 Clinton\u2026\n\nWe must draw from the rich foundation of our founding fathers\u2019 fight for democracy, And lead our friends and allies with more determination than ever before,\n\nWith conviction in our beliefs that pierces through the ideology of any people orany nation that attacks America\u2019s way of life and our proud heritage of fearlessness and courage.\n\nTonight, Americans stand as one\u2026with strength and confidence to overcome the last eight years of the Obama-Clinton failures\u2026such as, bumbling indecisiveness\u2026 willful ignorance\u2026 and total incompetence that has challenged the very heart and soul of every American, and single-handedly brought continued mayhem, murder and destruction into our neighborhoods and onto the world\u2019s streets.\n\nOn this day, we start the beginning of a new American Century \u2013 a time when we turn our heads forward with persistent and relentless focus on protecting our communities, our families and our country with feet firmly planted on the ground and by holding individuals accountable for their actions \u2013 equally and fairly.\nOur new American Century does not risk its future on political correctness and senseless hyperbole.\n\nThe time is now to recognize our obligation we have to the world \u2013 an obligation to lead the world with unwavering integrity\u2026renewed strength\u2026and unapologetic resolve.\n\nAnd, with Donald Trump in the White House, WE\u2026WILL\u2026MAKE\u2026AMERICA\u2026 GREAT\u2026 AGAIN!\n\nAmerica\u2019s once traditional, undisputed role as world leader is now in jeopardy. The Obama-Clinton duo failed our country by defying America\u2019s exceptionalism and betraying our nation\u2019s history and founding fathers\u2019 revolutionary spirit\u00a0 that established America on the principles of freedom and\u00a0 democracy.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism was a core principle when the United States led and won our battles.\n\nUnder this doctrine we led the Allies to victory in World War Two against NaziGermany, WE are the first country to put a man on the moon, We ended the Cold War and,\u00a0WE stopped communism\u2019s quest for world domination.\n\nAs Ronald Reagan said, \u201cIf we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to.This is the last stand on Earth.\u201d\n\nA centerpiece of American foreign policy was once the protection of the United States and its people and interests around the world.\n\nSadly, under current leadership that is no longer the case \u2013 this cannot stand. Period.\n\nWe must recognize that America has enemies in our homeland and abroad. And our military needs to be capable of protecting the nation by finding and capturing our enemies.\n\nThe President must have the tools to deal with all threats to our country, and MUST have the guts to put them into action whenever necessary.\nDonald Trump is that leader.\n\nWe must regain our ability to truly crush our enemies.\n\nAnd our Soldiers deserve to hear from their leaders with clarity and precision. Too often, our troops are instead distracted by trivial matters about what\u00a0 word to use, what terminology is politically correct, and what bathroom door to open. War is not about bathrooms, political correctness, or words that are meaningless.\n\nWar is about winning, there is no such thing as a runner-up, and there are no consolation prizes.\nA Commander-in-Chief does not draw \u201cred-lines\u201d and then retreat. America does not back down from anyone\u2026or anything.\n\nWe are tired of Obama\u2019s empty speeches and misguided rhetoric\u2026this has caused the world to have no respect for America\u2019s word; nor does it fear our might.\n\nLet me be clear \u2013 Coddling and displays of empathy toward terrorists is not a strategy for defeating these murderers as Obama and Hillary Clinton would like us to believe.\n\nAnd releasing terrorists will not end this war; on the contrary, it simply emboldens the terrorists and prolongs war.\n\nUnder Barack Obama, we have no coherent strategy to protect our citizens, and under Hillary Clinton, it will be more of the same.\nI am infuriated when our President bans criticism of our\u00a0enemies.\n\nI am certain we cannot win this war unless we are free to call our enemies by name \u2013 \u2013 radical Islamists and failed tyrants.\n\nBecause of Obama\u2019s ill-advised actions, the world has lost faith in American leadership\u2026and the threats are mounting:\n\nWe have become the best enemies and the worst friends.\n\nThe next four years will be consumed by the perils we now face. And the so- called redlines or reset buttons were utter failures. And the Obama-Clinton failed foreign policy list goes on and on.\n\nWe need a Commander-in-Chief who understands these challenges and is willing to do whatever it takes to meet them head-on.\nOur adversaries must never again mock American willpower and we must NEVER give them a reason to doubt our resolve to win.\n\nThe most damaging example of the President\u2019s failure to understand the consequences of putting political expediency ahead of national security is the emergence of ISIS\u2026We cannot continue down this path.\n\nWhat keeps me up at night is the sobering realization that evil exists. The radicalization of Islam and its barbaric cause that uses modernity to influence potentially millions around the world to join their cause should keep us all up at night.\n\nWe must take seriously the possibility that these enemies have weapons of mass destruction and intend to use them.\n\nWe must understand and define our enemies if we intend to defeat them. America and Americans deserve no less!\n\nBecause Obama chose to conceal the actions of terrorists like Osama bin Ladenand groups like ISIS, and the role of Iran in the rise of radical Islam, Americans\u00a0\u00a0 are at a loss to fully understand the enormous threat they pose against us.\n\nNow is the time for a leader that is honest and strong. A leader who will stand\u00a0up\n\nfor America, and make absolutely clear that if you cross her path\u2026you will \u00a0pay the price.\n\nWe do not need a weak, spineless President who is more concerned about issuing apologies than in protecting Americans.\nWe do not need a reckless President who believes she is above the law.\n\nI have called on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race because she put our nation\u2019s security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server.\n\nIf I did a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail. Crooked Hillary Clinton \u2013 leave this race now!\n\nBefore I end, I will repeat my belief that American exceptionalism is\u00a0 real.\n\nLet us not fear what we know to be true, instead we should always remember that our country was built upon, Judeo-Christian values and principles; and instead let us remember the sacrifices of those who have gone before us.\n\nAmerica is unique and is the greatest country in the history of the world. So get ready America, now is the time to elect fresh, bold\u00a0 leadership!\nI promise you that Donald Trump knows that the primary role of the President is to keep us safe.\n\nHe recognizes the threats we face and is not afraid to call them what they are.Donald Trump\u2019s leadership, decision-making and problem-solving abilities will restore America\u2019s role as the undeniable and unquestioned world leader.\n\nHe will lead from the front, not from behind.\n\nHe will lead with courage\u2026never vacillating when facing our enemies or our competitors.\n\nAnd he knows that the advantage in life, in business, and in wartime goes to the competitor that does not flinch and does not broadcast his game\u00a0plan.\nDonald Trump will execute the fundamental tenet of peace through strength\u2026and there will be no apologies for our American exceptionalism or leadership standing around the world.\n\nSO WAKE UP AMERICA, YOU CANNOT SIT THIS ONE OUT, instead, elect\n\nDonald Trump as the next President of the United States. Thank you.\n\nJeff Sessions\n\nThank you good friends.\u00a0 Speaking from this podium today is a long way from the rafter seats my wife and I had as college students in Miami in 1972.\n\nOur voters spoke clearly on two critical issues in our primaries: trade and immigration.\u00a0 They affirmed Donald Trump and his positions.\n\nThey oppose Obamatrade.\u00a0 They demand a lawful system of immigration that protects their safety and their financial well-being.\n\nAverage Americans have been the first to know something is wrong with this economy.\n\nOur middle class is steadily declining, with our African American and Hispanic communities being hurt the most.\u00a0 But, the Washington establishment, the media, and big corporations have been in denial.\n\nFellow Republicans, we must understand that the incomes of middle class Americans today are $4,186 per year less than in 1999.\n\nThis is an economic disaster.\u00a0 We are on the wrong track and the people know it.\n\nYet, Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan is more of the same: more government, more taxes, more regulation, more immigration, and more debt.\n\nShe has been a champion of globalist trade agreements. But the facts are in.\u00a0They have not worked for our people.\u00a0 When those agreements were signed, Presidents Clinton and Obama promised our dangerous trade deficits with Chinaand Korea would be reduced.\u00a0 But, the deficit with China has increased five-fold and the deficit with Korea doubled. These are job-killing numbers.\u00a0 Worst of all, they are now pushing the disastrous 5,554-page Obamatrade \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.\n\nThis election has also been about immigration.\u00a0 For 30 years, our good people have rightly pleaded for an end to the lawlessness, and for sound immigration policies that are fair and advance the national interest.\n\nTo this legitimate plea, our elites have responded with disdain, dismissal, and scorn.\n\nBut is there anyone in America that does not understand that when we bring in more workers than we have jobs for that job prospects and wages will fall? Top economists and the Congressional Budget Office have told us that.\u00a0 Is it too much to ask that we slow down and protect our national security and jobs?\n\nLet\u2019s consider the facts.\u00a0 We lawfully admit 1.1 million permanent residents annually, more than any other country.\u00a0 In addition, we have 700,000 foreign guest workers taking jobs.\n\nThe majority of these are not seasonal or agricultural.\u00a0 There are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year, and almost 500,000 more unlawfully overstay their visas.\u00a0 These are extreme numbers.\u00a0 But the only solution from Obama and Hillary Clinton is to capitulate to the lawlessness and give amnesty and citizenship to all.\n\nUnderstand this.\u00a0 From 2000 to 2014, while our existing population increased by millions, the number of jobs held by Americans actually declined.\n\nAmazingly, all the net job growth during that period went to immigrants.\u00a0 Combine that with the reality of efficient businesses, robots, and slow growth.\n\nThe fact is, we don\u2019t have enough jobs for the people who are here.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t this help to explain why our wages have fallen and why we have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years?\u00a0 Our duty as elected officials is to get our people jobs first.\n\nIt cannot be our policy to have workers from abroad take jobs while we provide support payments for unemployed Americans.\n\nBad trade deals close factories, and end high paying jobs.\u00a0 Excess immigration floods the labor market reducing jobs and wages.\n\nImproper vetting places our nation at risk of terrorism.\u00a0 Remember, the President has the clear power to \u201csuspend\u201d immigration to protect America.\n\nAmericans want help now.\u00a0This election will make it happen.\n\nThat is why we need Donald Trump.\n\nDonald Trump is the leader that will bring change.\n\nHe has the strength, courage, and will to get it done.\u00a0 He is attracting more and more Independents and Democrats to our movement.\n\nDonald Trump will kill Obamatrade.\n\nDonald Trump will build the wall.\n\nDONALD TRUMP WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\n", "I am here to speak to you about how to make America safe.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe.\u00a0 They fear for their children and they fear for themselves.\n\nThey fear for our police officers who are being targeted.\n\nWe pray for our police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge and their families; And we say thank you to the Cleveland Police Department for protecting us and all police officers protecting all of us.\n\nWe also reach out with understanding and compassion to those who have lost loved ones because of police shootings unjustified and justified.\n\nIt\u2019s time to make America safe again.\n\nIt\u2019s time to make America ONE again.\n\nI know it can be done because I did it by changing New York City from \u2018the crime capital of America\u2019 to according to the FBI the safest large city in America.\n\nWhat I did for New York City\u2026\u2026.\n\nDonald Trump WILL do for America.\n\nI have known Donald Trump for almost 30 years. And he has created and accomplished great things.\u00a0\u00a0 But beyond that this is a man with a big heart.\n\nEvery time New York City suffered a tragedy, Donald Trump was there to help.\n\nAnd he did it anonymously. (I bet that\u2019s a surprise)\n\nYou deserve to know this personal side about our next President.\u00a0 He has been a great father, father-in-law, grandfather and friend to me and my family.\n\nHe will keep us safe and help us achieve and embrace our greatness.\n\nIn the last seven months, there have been five major Islamic extremist terrorists attacks on us and our allies.\u00a0 We must not be afraid to define our enemy;\n\n\n\n It is Islamic extremist terrorism.\n\n'I did not say all of Islam.\n\nI said Islamic extremist terrorism.\n\nFailing to identify them properly maligns decent Muslims around the world.\n\nIt also sets up a fear of being politically incorrect that can have serious consequences.\u00a0And it has.\n\nThis is why our enemies see us as weak and vulnerable.\n\nDonald Trump has said the first step in defeating our enemies is to identify them properly and see the connections between them.\n\nTo defeat Islamic extremist terrorism we must put them on defense.If they are at war against us \u2014 which they have declared \u2014 we must commit ourselves to\u00a0unconditional victory against them.\n\nThis includes undoing one of the worst deals America ever made \u2013 Obama\u2019s Nuclear Agreement with Iran that will eventually let them become a nuclear power and put billions of dollars back into a country that the world\u2019s biggest state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nDonald Trump will make sure that any agreement with Iran meets the original goals of the U.N and our allies: a non-nuclear Iran.\n\nDonald Trump is a leader.\u00a0 He will reassert America\u2019s position as the nation with the best values to lead the world.\n\nIt was Hillary Clinton who advocated for the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.\n\nNow Libya is in chaos.\n\nHillary Clinton is accountable for this and much more.\n\nHer dereliction of duty and failure to keep her people safe played a major role in the horrific Islamic terrorist murders on September 11-12, 2012 in Benghazi which claimed the lives of four brave Americans; our Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, and CIA agents Tyrone S. Woods, and Glen Doherty.\n\nAnd Clinton, and the Obama administration, for political reasons lied about the purpose of the attacks including her lying directly to the families of those who were killed.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s answer to Congress about the death of these four brave Americans because of her failures as Secretary of State was \u201cwhat difference at this point does it make?\u201d\n\nWatch the video for yourself and see the arrogant disregard for American lives lost unnecessarily.\u00a0 Make up your own mind.\n\nAnyone who can say that it makes no difference how or why people serving America are killed, should not be entrusted with the awesome responsibility to protect them and us and should not be allowed to be our Commander in Chief.\n\nWho would trust her to protect them?\n\nI do not.\n\nDo you?\n\nDonald Trump will change all of that.\n\nIn short he will lead by leading, not by following.\n\nYou know Donald Trump will secure our borders\nHis opponent has had her chance to do this and failed. Hillary Clinton is for open borders.\n\nShe is in favor of taking in Syrian refugees even though the Islamic state\u00a0 has told us they are going to put their operatives in these groups so they can carry out terrorist acts against us and our allies.\n\nWe can\u2019t afford to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s experience is the basis for her campaign.\u00a0 Well, Hillary Clinton\u2019sexperience is exactly the reason she should not be our president.\n\nThere is no more time for us left to revive our great country.\u00a0 No more time to repeat our mistakes of the past.\n\nWashington needs a complete turnaround and Donald Trump is the agent of change and he will be the leader of the change we need.\n\nHe will make America, like the president I worked for Ronald Reagan, once again be the shining City on the Hill.\n\nVote for Donald Trump for a safer America and for an America headed in a different direction\u2026\u2026\u2026Greatness!\u00a0\u00a0God Bless the United States of America.\n\n'\n", "Distinguished delegates, Republicans, and millions of my fellow Americans watching around the country, especially those in Iowa: it\u2019s an honor to be with you from Cleveland, and to be on this stage with fellow veterans. Among them are Special Operations Master Sargent Jason Beardsley, and my colleague, Congressman and Navy SEAL\u00a0Ryan\u00a0Zinke, who you\u2019ll hear from shortly.\n\nI never would have imagined a small town girl like me, from Red Oak would have the opportunity to serve as the first woman elected to federal office from Iowa: however, my parents always said to my brother, sister, and me that if we worked hard, anything was possible.\n\nGrowing up, we didn\u2019t have much, but what we didn\u2019t have in money, my parents, particularly my mom, made up for with tenacity.\n\nShe really encouraged us: you\u2019d never hear her say \u201cno you can\u2019t do this.\u201d Instead, if something was challenging, she\u2019d say \u201cJoni, we\u2019ll figure out a way. If this is what you want, let\u2019s make it happen: we\u2019ll figure it out together.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a trait I carry with me today, and it\u2019s something I teach my own daughter. In our household, and in the homes of many of those in the military, including those up here tonight, giving up, quitting or accepting failure are not options.\n\nThat resilience is not unique to our house: that \u201ccan do\u201d attitude has served as the foundation of our country for 240 years. It continues tonight here in Ohio, inIowa, and all around our great nation.\n\nIn between my freshman and sophomore years in college, I went on an agricultural exchange to the Soviet Union. At night, the Ukrainians didn\u2019t talk about farming: rather, they wanted to know what it was like to live in a country where they could experience freedom. They wanted to know about our country, a place where anything was possible.\n\nWhen I came home, I realized it wasn\u2019t enough to simply enjoy freedom and liberty: I had to do my part to protect and preserve it. So I joined the military which as those of us up here with me know is a tremendously important institution that defends the freedoms that we Americans cherish.\n\nI\u2019ve had the great privilege of serving my state and our country while working alongside some of our nation\u2019s finest soldiers. For 14 months I served as a company commander during Operation Iraqi Freedom where my unit was tasked with running convoys through Kuwait and southern Iraq. Last November, after more than 23 years of service, I retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard.\n\nAs I travel across Iowa and around our great country, I hear from folks who are worried America is no longer leading, but rather following from behind.\n\nThose concerns are echoed by our allies around the world, and rightfully so.\n\nThe question I hear time and again is \u201cwhere is America\u2019s leadership?\u201d There\u2019s a void in the world: a deficit that cannot be filled by others. Our country and the world of which we are a part simply cannot afford four more years of this lack of leadership under Hillary Clinton.\n\nOur allies see us shrinking from our place as a leader in the world as we have failed time and again to address threats. They are looking for American leaders who are willing to stand up and say \u2018enough is enough.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, Hillary Clinton cannot be trusted. Her judgment and character are not suited to be sitting in the most powerful office in the world.\n\nShe has already failed us too many times before.\n\nHillary Clinton has failed to stop the expansion of terrorism\u2014her policies inLibya, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria have created more safe havens for terrorism. Shockingly, she continues to support a policy that brings captured terrorists into our back yards. All of us up here believe that\u2019s unacceptable.\n\nHillary Clinton has failed to support our allies\u2014her decision to back the Irannuclear deal puts in peril our longtime friends and allies in the region, especiallyIsrael. They have continued to threaten to destroy Israel, both directly and indirectly through its terrorist proxies, such as Hezbollah. They remain the top sponsor of terrorism, which endangers not just Israel, but Europe and the United States.\n\nAnd look at the pathetic track record she and Obama have in the war on ISIS. This administration has called them junior varsity adversaries, ignoring some of the best advice they were given. They represent a threat that is not limited to theMiddle East, and which is spreading rapidly. In fact, according to the FBI, ISIS is present in all 50 states. Think about that for a moment. Terrorists from ISIS are in every one of our 50 states.\u00a0 They will use whatever weapons they have: guns, trucks, knives, poisons, and bombs to kill innocent people.\n\nUnder this current administration\u2019s wayward policies, ISIS continues to spread, while the President fails to put forward a comprehensive strategy to defeat and destroy them.\n\nYet Hillary Clinton has failed to protect our national security in other ways. She jeopardized our safety by deciding our laws don\u2019t apply to her, setting up her own private e-mail server, and then lying about how it was used.\n\nOur men and women of the armed services do not fail us: they cannot. The veterans beside me did not fail us: they too are individuals of the highest integrity. Our presidents cannot fail us either: how can we accept Hillary Clintonwhen she has failed them, failed us, and cannot be trusted? She has proven time and again that she is entirely unfit to serve our nation as Commander-in-Chief.\n\nFor too long Americans have felt abandoned, and their warnings unheard. Donald Trump has heard these voices loud and clear. We cannot afford four more years of the same failed policies.\n\nIf that is not enough, the Veteran\u2019s Administration has been failing those who have served alongside those of us here on stage with me tonight, with scandal after scandal at the highest levels. Inferior care, long wait times, extraordinary inefficiency, and a bureaucracy that has gone wild still continues.\n\nWe need a commander-in-chief who will stand up to our enemies and stand up for our veterans. We need a leader who will ensure America remains a strong, stabilizing force around the globe, and who will keep us safe here at home.\n\nOur country cannot take another four years just like the eight we\u2019ve just had. It is time to stand up and fight for the security of our children, our grandchildren, and ourselves.\n\nWith Hillary Clinton it\u2019s always about her, when it should be about you. Donald Trump is focused on you. He gave voice to a movement of millions of Americans who are tired of politics as usual, and I know as president he will work tirelessly to keep our nation safe.\n\nNow is the time to make America safe again.\n\nThank you, and may God bless all of you, the wonderful state of Iowa, our brave men and women in uniform, and these great United States of America.\n\n", "Good evening Cleveland.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud to be on stage tonight with other dedicated service people, including Senator Ernst and Representative Zinke.\n\nAs an elite soldier, I operated at times as the only American in the midst of enemies. Still, no matter how dangerous the mission \u2013\u2013 I never lost my conviction that America was the world\u2019s best hope for good.\n\nThis same conviction can sustain this nation when we find ourselves imperiled. And this is such a time.\n\nFrom 9/11, to Russian aggression, to belligerent China, to the evil Islamic State, we face unparalleled threats.\n\nWe stand here on the shoulders of giants and legends who gave us this American Republic.\u00a0 We think of those who pioneered this country with courage and honor through a bloody revolution, and those who gave their lives for the cause of freedom around the world.\n\nToday, at this crucial point in our history, can we summon the spirit that forged our nation and bound us together under principles of liberty and justice for all?\u00a0 It\u2019s time for us once again to choose freedom over tyranny.\n\nOver the last eight years, the US has traded her role of active leadership for that of a passive observer. Americans have been told that the US has not always been a force for good. That since we have made mistakes, we should forfeit our leadership or \u201clead from behind.\u201d\n\nThis thinking has endangered not just the US but freedom across the world.\u00a0 The results fall squarely on the shoulders of the current administration, supported byHillary Clinton.\n\nHer leadership was absent as US Marines were forced to smash their weapons while bureaucrats abandoned our embassy in Yemen.\u00a0 It was absent as enemies overran our consulate and killed four Americans in Benghazi.\u00a0 This so-called leadership thanked our enemies in Iran while our sailors were on their knees.\n\nIt\u2019s time we put someone in office who holds the same conviction that we hold, that my fellow warrior heroes and I hold, and that my friends bled and died for.\n\nAs service members, we live by these convictions. Imagine a country where our President shares those convictions and upholds the honor of our military, knows our past and defends liberty.\u00a0 With that leadership, we will go over the top and into the teeth of the 21 century.\n\nIn Donald Trump\u2019s America, we will have that leadership and the only time service members will get on their knees will be to thank their God that they are Americans.\n\n", "I\u2019m honored to be sharing a stage with Senator Ernst, Jason Beardsley, and these distinguished fellow veterans.\n\nWhat a circle of honor.\n\nI proudly represent the state of Montana in the House.\n\nBefore being elected to Congress, I spent 23 years as a U. S. Navy SEAL, and was a commander at SEAL Team Six.\n\nWhen my daughter was growing up, I told her two things: Don\u2019t join the Navy and never marry a SEAL. She ignored me and did both.\n\nEver heard of a place called Gitmo?\u00a0 Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m personally acquainted with many of the individuals now experiencing those accommodations.\n\nWe heard from Marcus Luttrell. Ever hear of Chris Kyle, Rob O\u2019Neill, Glenn Doherty and Ty Woods? I had the privilege of working with Marcus and these other American heroes.\u00a0 I mentored many more whose names you will never know.\n\nSuccess as a Navy SEAL depends on three factors.\n\nThe first is teamwork. You need to know with certainty the guy behind you literally has your back.\n\nThe second is training.\u00a0 Warfighters going into dangerous places need the skills, expertise, and the rules of engagement to complete no-fail missions.\n\nLastly: Never Quit.\n\nWithout teamwork, training, and never quitting, successful missions, like the one that killed Osama Bin Laden, aren\u2019t possible.\n\nAnd, when we don\u2019t do things right in dangerous situations, bad things happen.\n\nIn January, Army Green Beret Matthew McClintock lost his life in Afghanistan, when his unit came under heavy Taliban fire.\n\nCommanders on the ground requested air support.\u00a0 None came.\n\nThis tragedy represents the weakness we have come to expect from armchair quarterbacks Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nSenator Ernst ably described Hillary Clinton\u2019s leadership failures. But the buck stops with the president.\n\nFor President Obama, being popular is more important than being Commander in Chief.\n\nHe abandoned Iraq.\u00a0He drew a red line in Syria and then refused to enforce it.\n\nHe reached a na\u00efve nuclear arms agreement with Iran \u2013 a country where people chant \u201cDeath to America\u201d in the street.\n\nHe watched passively as China and Russia filled the international leadership vacuum he created.\u00a0The world knows our president is weak, and that his anointed successor, the architect of Benghazi, is no better.\n\nTogether Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton brought us ISIS and brought down Benghazi. I shudder to think what she will bring if she is sitting in the Oval Office.\n\nI have been to too many funerals. Casualties are inevitable in war. But the lives ofSergeant McClintock and four Americans in Benghazi could have been saved with leadership in the White House.\n\nDonald Trump isn\u2019t afraid to talk about radical Islamic terrorism, and he won\u2019t be afraid to destroy it.\n\nWe need a Commander in Chief who will support our troops rather than abandon them in Benghazi.\n\nWe need a Commander in Chief who will put veterans in front of the line rather than let them die in line\n\nAnd we need a Commander in Chief who will stand with Israel rather than fund Iranian rockets that attack Israel.\n\nIt\u2019s time to rally behind our troops. It\u2019s time to rally behind our nominee. Donald Trump will make America lead again.\n\nThank you!\n\nClinton/Kaine: 228\n\nTrump/Pence: 290\n\nDemocrats: 48*(+2)\n\nRepublicans: 52(-2)\n\nDemocrats: 193(+6)\n\nRepublicans: 238(-6)\n\n", "What an honor it is to be with all of you this evening\u2026and especially to be here in Cleveland\u2026where we have nominated the individual who is GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\u2026.Donald J.

You might be wondering why I\u2019m here.\n\nI\u2019m not a politician. I\u2019m a fight promoter.\n\nTo be honest, I was surprised to be invited, but I was honored, and I wanted to show up to tell you about my friend, the Donald Trump that I know.\n\nIn 2001, when my partners and I bought the UFC, it was considered a blood sport.\n\nState athletic commissions didn\u2019t support us.\u00a0 Arenas around the world refused to host our events. Nobody took us seriously.\n\nNobody\u2026.\u2026 except Donald Trump.\n\nDonald was the first guy that recognized the potential that we saw in the UFC\u2026 and encouraged us to build our business.\n\nHe hosted our first two events at his venue. He dealt with us personally.\n\nHe got in the trenches with us\u2026 and made a deal that worked for everyone. And he showed up to the fights and sat in the front row. Yeah, he\u2019s that guy. He shows up.\n\nDonald championed the UFC before it was popular, before it grew into the successful business that it is now. I will always be grateful to him for standing with us in those early days.\n\nSo tonight, I\u2019m standing with Donald Trump.\n\nLet me tell you three things I respect about this\u00a0man.\n\nFirst, Donald has great business instincts. He supports businesses of all sizes.\n\nHe\u2019ll make it possible for them to grow and succeed, which is the backbone of a strong economy.\n\nSecond, Donald is a hard worker.\n\nHe will roll up his sleeves, he will work with people, and put in the time to get things done.\n\nAnd third, for over 15 years, Donald Trump has been a loyal\u2026 and supportive\u2026 friend.\n\nI know that if I need him, he\u2019ll be there for me, just like he was when we first met. Sometimes he\u2019ll call just to say, \u201cHey Dana, I\u2019ll be watching the fights this weekend. Good luck,\u201d \u2026 and he\u2019s always reached out when something good happens in my career.\n\nIn 2011, we signed a huge network TV deal with FOX, and there was a big write-up about it in the New York Times.\n\nDonald sent me the article and wrote on the front of it, \u201cCongratulations Dana, I always knew you would do it.\u201d\n\nAnd just for the record, Donald and I are not business partners. His interest in me and my business is personal.\n\nYou can really tell a person\u2019s true character when they are happy for someone else\u2019s success.\n\nAnd I think that sense of loyalty and commitment will translate into how he will run this country.\u00a0 And let\u2019s honest, we need someone who believes in this\u00a0 country.\n\nWe need someone who is proud of this country, who will fight for this\u00a0 country.\n\nLet me tell you something: I have been in the fight business my whole life.\u00a0 I know fighters.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, Donald Trump is a fighter. And I know Donald Trump will fight for this country. Thank you.\n\n", "Ladies and gentlemen, I hail from the great state of Arkansas; we know from personal experience that we don\u2019t need Hillary Clinton in the White\u00a0House.\n\nI have been in the public arena during the administration of six Presidents.\n\nFrom federal prosecutor under President Reagan; to Congress; and then Homeland Security after 9/11, I have seen America at its best and I have seen America put to the test.\n\nThere has never been a more urgent time for leadership.\n\n\u2014\u2013America\u2019s strength and boldness are desperately needed on the world stage.\n\n\u2014\u2014and a new energy is demanded at home to build our economy and to defeat terrorism.\n\nStrength, boldness and new energy are not words that describe Hillary Clinton. This is the same Hillary we knew in Arkansas and later in Washington for so many years. Hillary always wanted more government, and her dreams have only gotten bigger.\n\nRegretfully, she offers more of the same.\u00a0The same uncertain leadership in fighting terrorism;\n\nThe same failed\u2026.top down approach to health care\u2026.where Washington tells the states what to do;\n\nThe same nanny state regulations that strangle the economic strength of America. If you like the last 8 years, then Hillary will give you double for\u00a0 your trouble!\n\nBut good things are happening in the states. In Arkansas, we are creating jobs and leading in computer science education.\n\nUnemployment is the lowest in the recorded history of Arkansas and we have a$177 million surplus.\u00a0\u00a0 We can do better in our country.\n\nWe need a President that values the role of the states, will destroy ISIS, and jump-start our economy.\n\nExperience matters.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton emphasizes her experience. Yes.\u00a0 Experience matters.\u00a0 But judgment matters more.\n\nDespite her experience, Hillary Clinton\u2019s poor decisions have produced bad results.\n\nJust think about it\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s radical attempts at so-called \u201creform\u201d of the nation\u2019s healthcare system would have been more destructive than even Obamacare has been.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s bad judgment, as you heard last night, left us four dead Americans in Benghazi.\n\nIt resulted in instability in Egypt, Syria and Libya; the rise of ISIS; the resurgence of Russia; an emboldened North Korea; inappropriate ties between foreign governments and the Clinton Foundation; and a more dangerous\u00a0 world.\n\nWhen it comes to being Commander in Chief, we don\u2019t want a President who in the words of the FBI is \u201cextremely careless\u201d in the handling of classified material.\n\nDonald Trump represents a different kind of leadership. He is exactly the kind of transparent, straight-talking leader America needs right\u00a0 now.\n\nA Hillary Clinton presidency will endanger our national security.\u00a0 IT:\n\n\u2014-will be the wrong direction for our economy\n\n\u2014-and will undermine the innovation coming from the states. A Trump Presidency will be about the art of the possible.\n\nDonald Trump is the right leader for our time.\u00a0Thank you.\n\n", "Good evening. Sometimes, Hillary Clinton has a New York accent. Sometimes, anArkansas accent.\n\nBut y\u2019all\u2026.this is what a real Arkansas woman sounds like.\n\nHillary may not know where she\u2019s from, but Arkansans know exactly who she is. Arkansans know who I am.\n\nRaised on a cattle farm, married to a row crop farmer, I\u2019m a Christian, pro-life, gun- carrying, conservative woman.\n\nAnd, the first female Republican elected Attorney General of\u00a0Arkansas.\n\nThe very same office Bill Clinton held when those two launched their careers of corruption.\n\nHillary says they were poor when they left the White\u00a0House.\n\nAnd while they\u2019ve made millions, she\u2019s still poor in all the ways that really count: poor judgment, poor policies and poor decisions. Hillary is a lawyer, but she acts like the law doesn\u2019t apply to her.\n\nAbsolutely no good could have come from merging her public service with her private interests\u2026much less her private\u00a0 server.\n\nWhat we know about her scandals is bad. What we don\u2019t know may be worse.\n\nWhy did Bill\u2019s speaking fees skyrocket as soon as she was Secretary of State? Why did donors to the Clinton Foundation receive favorable treatment from the State Department?\u00a0 Deception and dishonesty are all second nature to\u00a0 Hillary.\n\nAs my daddy likes to say, she will lie [even] when the truth would serve her better.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: That woman has more baggage than Chicago O\u2019Hare. I broke a glass ceiling.\n\nI know the importance of doing so.\n\nBut, a historical milestone need not come at the expense of America. Unlike Hillary, Donald Trump knows that women \u2013 and men \u2013 are not single issue voters.\n\nWe care about jobs, the economy and national security.\n\nAs Attorney General, I know this race will shape the Supreme Court for generations.\n\nDo we want the great Antonin Scalia to be replaced by a liberal activist judge? Donald Trump will nominate conservative justices who will uphold the Constitution, support the rule of law and rein in out-of-control federal\u00a0 bureaucrats.\n\nFrankly, Hillary needs to go to her own house, not the White House\u2026and takeRuth Bader Ginsberg with her.\n\nMy fellow Americans, it\u2019s time to update your resumes because Donald Trump is growing jobs and putting America back to work.\n\nWith Donald Trump as President\u2026.America will be closed to overregulation and open for business.\n\nGod bless each of you and God Bless\u00a0America.\n\n", "Over the years, Hillary Clinton has done a lot and said a lot to show why she should not be president.\n\nBut how she treated government secrets as Secretary of State, and what she said before and after she was caught, sums up the case against\u00a0her.\n\nShe sent and received secret, and top-secret, and beyond-top-secret emails on an unsecure private email system instead of on the secure government system \u2013 and she did it without authorization.\n\nShe said \u2013 falsely \u2013 that there was no classified information. She said \u2013\u00a0 falsely \u2013 that what she did was authorized.\n\nAnd what else did she say \u2013 falsely? She said, \u201cWhen we traveled to sensitive places like Russia, we often received warnings from department security officials\u00a0 to leave our blackberrys, laptops \u2013 anything that communicated with the outside world \u2013 on the plane, with their batteries removed to prevent foreign intelligence services from compromising them.\u201d She said, \u201cEven in friendly settings we conducted business under strict security precautions, taking care when and how\u00a0 we read secret material and used our technology.\u201d That\u2019s from her book. The title\u00a0 of the book \u2014 ironically \u2013 is \u201chard choices.\u201d\n\nIn reality, we now know that she chose to use her private email overseas, in countries hostile to the United States and that have sophisticated hacking capability. Although her system was so remarkably primitive the FBI could not figure out whether or not it had been hacked, we know that the emails of people with whom she communicated were hacked.\n\nAbout her emails we have to ask ourselves the infamous question that\u00a0 she asked about the death of four Americans in Benghazi \u2013 \u201cwhat difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d\n\nWell, it makes a big difference.\n\nThis is the only country in the world that was founded on a law \u2013 the Constitution.\n\nHillary is running for an office \u2013 the presidency \u2014 whose powers and duties are defined by that law. The most important power that law gives the president is to be commander in chief of the armed forces \u2013 to protect the\u00a0 country.\n\nThat law imposes on the president the duty to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d That law \u2013 the Constitution \u2013 specifically requires that before taking up those powers and duties, the president swear to \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the office, and \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d the\u00a0 Constitution.\n\nHillary Clinton took a similar oath before she became secretary of\u00a0state.\n\nWhat that means is that Hillary Clinton is asking us, as Americans, to make her the first president to take the oath of office after already violating that\u00a0 oath.\n\nOur message for anyone watching these proceedings should be simple:\u00a0 NO WAY\n\n", "Thank you.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to be here.\n\nIt\u2019s been a lot of fun the last few days watching the media speculate about\u00a0me.\n\nWho\u2019s \u201cAndy Wist?\u201d they all asked.\n\nSomebody said I was Batman.\n\nThat\u2019s Adam West, dummy!\n\nSome of these reporters need to get a life!\n\nLook, you want to know who Andy Wist is?\n\nI\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m living proof that the American Dream is\u00a0 real.\n\nI grew up in Brooklyn and started a business in my mother\u2019s backyard when I was 21\u2026 Standard Waterproofing.\n\nWe restore building exteriors.\n\nToday we have 140 employees.\n\nNot as big as Mr. Trump\u2019s company, but still pretty good, right?\n\nI\u2019m also the trustee of Teamsters Local 522, because like Donald Trump and Mike Pence, I believe that working men and women still matter in this country and we have to look out for them.\n\nAfter 8 years of President Obama, I don\u2019t see the American Dream like I did when\u00a0 I was starting out.\n\nAll I see is too many people out of work\u2026 too many jobs shipped overseas\u2026 and too many politicians who don\u2019t care.\n\nIt\u2019s a mess\n\nWho\u2019s going to fix it?\n\nHillary Clinton?\n\nAfter 30 years in public life her only accomplishment is beating the rap every time she breaks the law.\n\nDonald Trump is a builder.\n\nHe\u2019s a leader who will bring us together\n\nHe\u2019ll make America work again, so we can believe again.\n\nI\u2019m not a big important person.\u00a0 I\u2019m just a regular\u00a0 guy.\n\nI love my family.\n\nI love my country.\n\nI\u2019ve lived a great life.\n\nBut I\u2019m not going to be around forever. Neither will you.\n\nThis November, we get to decide what kind of world we leave\u00a0 behind.\n\nWhen I\u2019m gone, I want my children, your children, and our grandchildren to be able to live the American Dream like I have.\n\nAnd the only way we keep the American Dream alive is by electing Donald Trump president.\n\nThank you!\n\n", "What difference, at this point, does it make?\u00a0I am the guy that provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just pick up the phone and call the survivors?\u201d\n\nBut instead of doing that, she hatched her cover-up story and repeatedly lied to the American people.\u00a0 She even lied to the surviving family members of\u00a0America\u2019s fallen heroes.\u00a0Think about that for a\u00a0moment.\n\nAnd, of course, Hillary\u2019s cold, calculated lying continues. If we can\u2019t trust her to tell us the truth, how can we possibly trust her to lead\u00a0America?\n\nSo let me tell you \u2014 and Hillary Clinton \u2014 what difference it does makes when America\u2019s leaders cannot be trusted \u2014 when our commander in chief fails miserably by employing a strategy of peace through withdrawal instead of achieving peace through strength.\n\nIt makes a difference to the young Yazidi woman I met who was captured and brutalized by ISIS barbarians, the joy of life hauntingly absent in her eyes.\n\nIt makes a difference to the travelers, passing through airports in Brussels andIstanbul, who just wanted to get home to their family and friends.\n\nIt makes a difference to the ordinary Americans sharing holiday cheer at a Christmas party in San Bernardino.\n\nIt makes a difference to the young men and women dancing on a summer night at a club in Orlando.\n\nAnd it makes a difference to the families watching fireworks at a celebration of freedom in Nice.\n\nThese are just a few examples of Islamic terrorists, let me repeat that \u2014 ISLAMIC TERRORISTS \u2014 slaughtering and brutalizing their innocent\u00a0 victims.\n\nWhen will America effectively respond to this terrible reality? We certainly won\u2019t if Democrats win in November.\n\nIn Wisconsin, I\u2019m running against Russ Feingold, who, even after 9/11, voted against giving law enforcement the tools they need to help stop international terror. During his eighteen year Senate career, he also voted against authorizing our military eleven separate times. And now he\u2019s asking Wisconsinites to give him a fourth term \u2014 just as Hillary Clinton is asking America to give her Obama\u2019s third term.\n\nThe world is simply too dangerous to elect either of them. Instead, America needs strong leadership.\n\nLeaders who will jumpstart our economy, secure our borders, strengthen our military, and accomplish the goal President Obama set over twenty-two months ago: We must defeat ISIS, and then remain fully committed to destroying Islamic terrorists wherever they hide.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t have to live in\u00a0fear.\n\nThis is a fight for freedom.\n\nIt\u2019s not someone else\u2019s fight, this is our fight. And it is a fight we absolutely must win.\n\nDonald Trump and Mike Pence understand that these must be America\u2019s top priorities.\n\nThey will be strong leaders, working with Republicans in the House and Senate to achieve a goal that can unite us all: A safe, prosperous, and secure\u00a0 America.\n\nOur future hangs in the balance.\n\nWe must unify, work tirelessly, and together, save this great nation.\n\nSo God Bless your efforts, and God Bless\u00a0America.\n\n", "I want to talk to you tonight about a very personal freedom: your right to protect your life.\n\nBecause as much as we don\u2019t like to think about it\u2026we live in dangerous times.\n\nWe\u2019re worried, and we have reason to be.\n\nBecause we know government has failed to keep us\u00a0safe.\n\nYou have to be able to protect yourself and your family. And that\u2019s what the Second Amendment is all about.\n\nImagine a young mother at home with her baby, when a violent predator kicks in the door.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019s a three-time loser who never should have been\u00a0 released from prison early. But he was, because some politician wanted to show their \u201ccompassion\u201d.\u00a0 So what\u2019s she going to do?\n\nShe\u2019ll dial 911\u2026and pray. The police will do their absolute best to get there quickly.\u00a0 But their average response time is 11 minutes.\n\nShould she be able to defend herself with a firearm in her own home? My fellow Americans, that question is on the ballot in\u00a0 November.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nEight years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that we have a fundamental, individual right to protect ourselves and our families with a firearm in our own homes.\n\nThey should\u2019ve ruled it nine-to-nothing, but the Second Amendment survived by just one vote. After Justice Scalia\u2019s death, that vote is\u00a0 gone.\n\nHere\u2019s where Hillary Clinton stands.\n\nShe said, quote, \u201cthe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nThink about that. All the Supreme Court said was you have the right to protect your life in your own home. Hillary says they got it wrong.\u00a0 It\u2019s that simple\u2026a Hillary Clinton Supreme Court means your right to own a firearm is\u00a0 gone.\n\nMake no mistake: this election isn\u2019t about the next four years. It\u2019s about the next forty years, so voting for Hillary Clinton, or not voting, is simply not an option.\n\nWhat\u2019s so outrageous is that for the rest of her life, Hillary Clinton will never even think about dialing 9-1-1.\n\nFor thirty years, she hasn\u2019t taken a walk, a nap or a bathroom break without a good guy with a gun there to protect her.\n\nSo it\u2019s easy for her to dismiss a right she will never have to use.\u00a0 But for the rest of us, the choice to own a firearm is ours to\u00a0 make.\n\nAnd in America, there cannot be one set of rules for the Clintons, and\u00a0 another set for us.\n\nBut here\u2019s Hillary\u2019s problem.\n\nAmerican women are the fastest-growing group of gun owners. Millions own firearms.\u00a0 And millions more are thinking about it.\u00a0 It\u2019s not Hillary Clinton who says women should have that choice. It\u2019s Donald Trump.\n\nDonald Trump is a life member of the NRA\u2026and so are his sons, Don and Eric\u2026because we\u2019re the largest and oldest civil rights organization in\u00a0 America.\n\nWe fight for the rights of all Americans, regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation\u2026because the right to protect your life is the most precious right\u00a0 you have.\n\nIf you agree\u2026you have to vote for Donald Trump.\n\nIf you believe women have the right to choose to own a firearm for themselves, you HAVE to vote for Donald Trump.\n\nFriends, the 5 million men and women of the NRA will fight without apology for your right to protect your life.\n\nBut we are on the cusp of losing this great American freedom\u2026and with it\u2026this great nation.\n\nThe only way we save it, the only way we save it is by electing Donald Trump the next President of the United States.\n\n", "Thank you.\n\nI appreciate this incredible opportunity to speak to you about a man that I greatly admire \u2026 a man I have found to be gracious, generous, and inspiring.\n\nI must begin, however, by saying there is a great deal of irony that I am speaking to you tonight because when I earned my Tour Card sixteen years ago, I was told there\u2019s only two things you don\u2019t talk about in public: Faith \u2026 and politics.\n\nWell, tonight, I am prepared to violate both those admonitions as I stand before you at the Republican National Convention as a Christian woman.\n\nI believe that God\u2019s timing is perfect: He puts people in our lives to help us make a positive impact on those around us\u2026 and to help us achieve our goals.\n\nOne of those people for me, is Donald Trump.\n\nThe first time I played golf with him in 2005, I shared two things that I\u2019d told countless CEOs, billionaires, and politicians before him: One, I had a dream to open up a Boys and Girls Club; and two, I was deeply frustrated about being treated differently as a woman \u2026 overlooked and underpaid in business.\n\nThese words previously fell on deaf, all-be-it well-intentioned ears \u2026 but that day was different.\n\nThey finally fell on ears that cared enough to take action.\n\nI\u2019m proud to tell you, that with Donald\u2019s help, I opened up the Natalie Gulbis, Boys and Girls Club.\n\nIn response to my frustrations about being treated unfairly as a woman, he adamantly rejected that notion\u2026 and instead, offered me a simple idea that changed my life forever: \u201cNever fear challenging the status quo.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s encouraged me to think of myself not as a female athlete, but as a business person.\n\n\u201cIn everything you do, be fearless,\u201d he\u2019d remind me. \u201cBe fearless.\u201d\n\nAs an athlete, fearlessness came naturally to me; but as a business woman, I faced challenges that weren\u2019t always on a level playing field. Even today, I face challenges and Donald remains a consistent voice encouraging me to stand up to gender injustices and to LEAN IN to any professional challenges that come my way.\n\nI hope you take these principles about generosity and fearlessness\u2026 and that they can have a similar impact for you in your life\u2026 like they have had in mine.\n\nRonald Reagan said, \u201cStatus quo is Latin for the mess we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nAnd while I believe that this is the greatest time to be a woman in the greatest country in the history of the world, I have no delusions that there isn\u2019t a mess to clean up \u2026 and we desperately need someone to clean up this mess.\n\nThat person is Donald Trump.\n\nIf one\u2019s history of fearlessness and challenging the status quo is an indicator for meaningful progress, then Donald Trump is the person to bring that to America.\n\nThank you\n\n", "Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ve been around a while.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve been around the Clintons more than anybody should ever have to. A couple years ago, Bill and Hillary camped out in my state telling anybody who\u2019d listen why they ought to vote against me. Tonight I\u2019m here to return the favor.\n\nI am a patient man. As a young child in the South, I was struck with polio and forced to stay off my feet for two years.\n\nThat experience taught me an abiding gratitude for my parents. And it taught me how to wait, which comes in handy when you\u2019re leading the U.S. Senate.\n\nMore than anything, though, my job has taught me the value of trust \u2026 how to distinguish between people who are in this to serve others and people who are in it for themselves.\n\nI am here to tell you Hillary Clinton will say anything, do anything, and be anything to get elected president.\n\nAnd we cannot allow it.\n\nThe American People are tired of hearing about the bounty of government while the cost of caring for a family or meeting daily expenses grows out of\u00a0 reach.\n\nOver the past few years, they\u2019ve seen government officials abuse their office and get rewarded for it.\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019ve seen the middle class\u00a0 shrink.\n\nAnd in the midst of all this they have raised a simple complaint. Who is looking out for us?\n\nIt is not Hillary\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve had my differences with Barack Obama, but l will give him this. At least he was up front about his plans to move America to the\u00a0 left.\n\nNot Hillary\u2026\n\nShe lied about her emails. She lied about her server. She lied about Benghazi. She lied about sniper fire.\n\nShe even lied about why her parents named her Hillary. So I ask a simple question.\n\nAt a moment when so many feel betrayed by their government.\n\nWhy in the world would Democrats put forward such a candidate?\n\nHillary has changed her positions so many times it\u2019s impossible to tell where conviction ends and ambition begins.\n\nIn 2010, she said Iran could enrich uranium. In 2014 she said she\u2019s always argued against it.\n\nOnce a backer of the Keystone pipeline, last year she opposed it. She used to be against sanctuary cities.\n\nThen she claimed to be for them.\u00a0 Who knows where she is now.\n\nFriends, not since Baghdad Bob has there been a public figure with such a tortured relationship with the truth.\n\nThere is a clear choice before us. And it is not Hillary.\n\nYou know what the next four years will look like with Hillary.\n\nAnd you know that if Hillary is president, we will continue to slide, distracted\u00a0 by the scandals that follow the Clintons like flies.\n\nTwo years ago, voters delivered a clear verdict on the Obama years by\u00a0\u00a0 sending a freshmen class of rock star Republicans to the Senate and delivering us a majority that I promised to make you proud of.\n\nWe\u2019d never hesitate to confront this President.\n\nBut we\u2019d also do the hard work of tackling urgent problems head on. We have delivered on that promise.\n\nWe put an Obamacare repeal bill on the President\u2019s desk.\u00a0 He vetoed\u00a0 it.\n\nTrump would sign it.\n\nWe passed a bill to finally build the Keystone Pipeline.\u00a0 He vetoed it.\n\nTrump would sign it.\n\nWe passed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood. Obama vetoed it. Trump would sign it.\n\nAnd on that sad day when we lost the great Antonin Scalia, I made another pledge that Barack Obama would not fill this seat. That honor will go to Donald Trump.\n\nWith Donald Trump in the White House, Senate Republicans will build on the work we\u2019ve done and pass more bills into law than any\u00a0 Senate in years.\n\nWe passed the first major education reform in more than a decade, and ended common core.\n\nWe made the first significant reforms to Social Security in three decades. We passed a crucial cybersecurity bill.\n\nWe imposed sanctions on North Korea\n\nWe passed the first major highway bill in more than a decade.\n\nWe passed a bill to combat the scourge of human trafficking.\n\nAnd just last week we passed, and the president signed, the first major law aimed at confronting the heartbreaking explosion of opioid and heroin\u00a0 abuse.\n\nKeep the Senate in Republican hands and we will continue this work.\n\nAnd the remarkable public servants that I am proud to lead in the Senate will not let you down.\n\nBut put Hillary Clinton in the White House and I promise you\u00a0this.\n\nShe will double down on the cynical approach that Senate Democrats seem to revel in these days.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean.\n\nAs we sit here tonight, a terrifying mosquito-borne illness threatens expectant mothers and their babies along the Southern Coast.\n\nAnd just last week, Clinton Democrats in the Senate blocked a bill aimed at eradicating that virus before it spread.\n\nThey blocked a defense funding bill. A bill that would support the brave men and women who are right now defending us overseas.\n\nWhat do these people think public service is about?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\n\nBut I know this. If Hillary Clinton is our president, nothing will change. So tonight, I ask you to let us continue our work.\n\nLet\u2019s put justices on the Supreme Court who cherish our Constitution. Let\u2019s keep the Senate!\n\nAnd let\u2019s elect a President and Vice President who really believe America is exceptional.\n\n", "Thank you all very much.\n\nDelegates, friends, and fellow citizens: I appreciate the privilege of addressing this forty-first convention of the Party of Lincoln.\n\nAs part of my co-chairman duties, let me thank all the people of this beautiful city for looking after us this week. And above all I want to thank the men and women here from law enforcement for your service.\n\nYou know, standing up here again, it all has a familiar feel. Students of trivia will recall that last time around I was your nominee for vice president. It was a great honor, even if things didn\u2019t work out quite according to plan.\n\nBut hey, I\u2019m a positive guy. I\u2019ve found other things to keep me busy. And I like to look at it this way. Next time there\u2019s a State of the Union address, I don\u2019t know where Joe Biden and Barack Obama will be. But you\u2019ll find me right there on the rostrum with Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump.\n\nDemocracy is a series of choices. We Republicans have made ours.\n\nHave we had our arguments this year? Sure we have \u2013 and you know what I call those? Signs of life. Signs of a party that\u2019s not just going through the motions. Not just mouthing new words for the same old stuff.\n\nMeanwhile, what choice has the other party made, in this incredible year filled with so many surprises?\n\nHere we are, at a time when men and women in both parties so clearly, so undeniably, want a big change in direction for America, a clean break from a failed system. And what does the Democratic Party establishment offer? What is their idea of a clean break?\n\nThey are offering a third Obama term, brought to you by another Clinton. And we\u2019re supposed to be excited about that?\n\nFor a country so ready for change, it feels like we had been cleared for takeoff, and then somebody announced we\u2019re all going back to the gate.\n\nIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve been on hold forever, waiting and waiting to finally talk to a real person, and somehow we\u2019ve been sent back to the main menu.\n\nWatch the Democratic Party convention next week \u2013 that four-day infomercial of politically correct moralizing. And let it be a reminder of all that is at stake in this election. You can get through four days of it, with a little help from the mute button. But four more years of it?\n\nNot \u2026 a \u2026 chance. The Obama years are almost over. The Clinton years are way over.\n\nTwo-thousand sixteen is the year America moves on.\n\n# # #\n\nFrom now to November, we will hear how many different ways progressive elitists can find to talk down to the rest of America \u2026 to tell voters that the Obama years have been good for you \u2026 that you should be grateful, and now, well, it\u2019s Hillary\u2019s turn.\n\nBut the problem is very simple. There is a reason people in our country are disappointed and restless.\n\nIf opportunity seems like it\u2019s been slipping away, that\u2019s because it has. And liberal progressive ideas have done exactly nothing to help. Wages never seem to go up.\n\nThe whole economy feels stuck. And for millions of Americans, middle-class security is now just a memory.\n\nProgressives like our president talk forever about poverty in America. And if high-sounding talk did any good, we\u2019d have overcome these deep problems long ago.\n\nThis explains why, under the most liberal president we\u2019ve had so far, poverty in America is worse \u2013 especially for our fellow citizens who were promised better and need it most.\n\nThe result is a record of discarded promises \u2026 empty gestures \u2026 phony strawman arguments \u2026 reforms put off forever \u2026 shady power plays, like the one that gave us Obamacare \u2026 constitutional limits brushed off as nothing \u2026 and, all the while, dangers in the world downplayed, even as the threats grow bolder and come closer.\n\n# # #\n\nIt\u2019s the latest chapter of an old story: progressives deliver everything except progress.\n\nYet we know better than to think that Republicans can win only on the failures of Democrats. It still comes down to the contest of ideas. Which is really good news, ladies and gentlemen, because when it\u2019s about ideas, the advantage goes to us.\n\nAgainst the dreary backdrop of arrogant bureaucracies \u2026 pointless mandates \u2026 reckless borrowing \u2026 willful retreat in the world \u2026 and all that progressives still have in store for us, the Republican Party stands as the great, enduring alternative.\n\nWe believe in making government, as Ronald Reagan said, not the distributor of gifts and privilege, but once again the protector of our liberties.\n\nLet the other party go on making its case for more government control over every aspect of our lives \u2013 more taxes to pay \u2026 more debt to carry \u2026 more rules to follow \u2026 more judges who just make it up as they go along.\n\nWe, in this party, are committed to a federal government that acts again as a servant accountable to the people, following the Constitution, and venturing not one inch beyond the consent of the governed.\n\nWe, in this party, offer a better way for our country, based on fundamentals that go back to the Founding generation. We believe in a free society where aspiration and effort can make the difference in every life \u2026 where your starting point is not your destiny \u2026 and where your first chance is not your only chance.\n\nWe offer a better way for America, with ideas that actually work. A reformed tax code that rewards free enterprise, instead of just enterprising lobbyists.\n\nA reformed health care system that operates by free choice, instead of by force, and doesn\u2019t leave you answering to cold, clueless bureaucrats.\n\nA renewed commitment to building a 21st-Century military \u2013 and to giving our veterans the care they were promised, the care that they have earned.\n\nAnd we offer a better way of dealing with persistent poverty in this country: A way that shows poor Americans the world beyond liberal warehousing and checkwriting \u2026 into the life everyone can find, with opportunity and independence \u2026 the happiness of using your gifts, and the dignity of having a job.\n\nAnd you know what? None of this will happen under Hillary Clinton.\n\nOnly with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance at a better way.\n\nAnd, last, let the other party go on and on with its constant dividing up of people \u2026 always playing one group against the other, as if group identity were everything.\n\nIn America, aren\u2019t we all supposed to see beyond class, or ethnicity, or all those other lines drawn to set us apart and lock us in groups?\n\nReal social progress is always a widening of the circle of concern and protection. It\u2019s respect and empathy overtaking blindness and indifference. It\u2019s understanding that by the true measure we are all neighbors and countrymen \u2013 called, each one of us, to know what is right and kind and just, and to go and do likewise.\n\nEveryone is equal \u2026 everyone has a place \u2026 no one is written off, because there is worth and goodness in every life.\n\nStraight from the Declaration of Independence, that is the Republican ideal \u2013 and if we won\u2019t defend it, who will?\n\n# # #\n\nSo much that you and I care about, so many things we stand for, are in the balance in the coming election. Whatever we lack going into this campaign, we should not lack for motivation. In the plainest terms I know, it is all on the line.\n\nSo let\u2019s act that way. Let\u2019s use the edge we have, because it is still what earns trust and votes. This year of surprises and dramatic turns can end in the finest possible way \u2013 when America elects a conservative governing majority.\n\nWe can do this, we can earn that mandate, if we don\u2019t hold anything back, if we never lose sight of the stakes. Our candidates will be giving their all, their utmost, and every one of us has got to do the same.\n\nSo what do you say we unite this party, at this crucial moment when unity is everything?\n\nLet\u2019s take the fight to our opponents with better ideas \u2013 let\u2019s get on the offensive and let\u2019s stay there.\n\nLet\u2019s compete in every part of America, and turn out at the polls like every last vote matters, because it will.\n\nFellow Republicans, what we have begun here, let\u2019s see it through \u2026 let\u2019s win this thing \u2026 let\u2019s show America our best and nothing less.\n\nThank you, and God bless.\n\n", "Hello Republicans! I\u2019m Dan Sullivan, from the great state of\u00a0Alaska.\n\nI\u2019m proud to be standing here tonight with my fellow freshman Senators. This is who we are: Governors and doctors, educators and ministers, CEOs and hog farmers, moms and dads\n\nWe have served in the United States Army and the United States\u00a0Marines.\n\nAnd now we serve America in the United States Senate. In 2014, YOU made this happen.\n\nRepublicans all across the country, coming together, who wanted new energy in the Senate, and who wanted to fire Harry Reid.\n\nAnd that\u2019s EXACTLY what we did.\n\nIn 2016, we need to keep that momentum going!\n\nWe need to keep the Senate, and win back the White House.\n\nWe will put coal miners and oil drillers back to work, not target them for extinction as Hillary promised.\n\nWe MUST reignite economic opportunity and the American dream for\u00a0 everybody.\n\nAnd TOGETHER we WILL make America great again\n\n", "Thank you.\n\nWe have listened and you have told us \u2014 ENOUGH. ENOUGH of feeling like your government is ignoring you. ENOUGH of Washington bailouts and handouts.\n\nENOUGH of feeling less safe and less secure in a more dangerous world where the bad guys are winning and the good guys are\u00a0 losing.\n\nBut I have good news \u2014 in just one hundred and twelve days \u2014 it\u2019s over. In this election the stakes have never been higher.\n\nDo we settle for the path we are on? Or do we take a better way?\n\nRepublicans believe that families who work hard should get ahead. Republicans believe in an America that isn\u2019t divided by race \u2014 religion \u2014 or gender. Republicans believe that America only works if we put your interests above the special interests.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what has happened over the past eight years.\n\nFor eight years we have had a President who promised us so much but delivered so little.\u00a0 The lies we were told about Obamacare.\n\nThe destruction of jobs and entire industries. The empowerment of Iran and the rise of ISIS.\u00a0 Republicans have a better way.\u00a0 We have a plan to fix it.\n\nIn our Republican agenda \u2014 our enemies will fear us. Our taxes will be fairer.\n\nPeople can afford the health care they want. The people\u2019s voice will be heard. Government will help those who truly need it and allow everyone an opportunity to rise.\n\nSo to all those left behind by economic forces out of your control \u2014 we hear\u00a0you\n\nTo those attacked for your beliefs \u2014 we hear\u00a0you!\n\nTo a nation that sees chaos spreading across America and across the globe \u2014 we hear you. And for our men and women in uniform \u2014 we hear you. As a matter of principle you will have the very best America has to\u00a0 offer.\n\nThose who fought on the front lines should NEVER have to wait in line. There is a better way.\n\nBut this Republican agenda can only be realized if we disrupt the status quo. And let\u2019s face it \u2014 Hillary Clinton is the definition of the status\u00a0 quo.\n\nWe need a leader who shapes the future.\n\nThe Democrats won\u2019t bring that future because they are stuck in the\u00a0past.\n\nWhen innovation has brought more power to the people \u2014 Democrats want more power for Washington.\n\nWhen innovation advances technology \u2014 Hillary Clinton uses it to put American secrets at risk.\n\nThis is not the path for our country.\n\nIn these difficult times I remember the words of President Ronald Reagan when he described America as that shining city upon the hill.\n\nTogether \u2014 by electing a Republican Congress \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 and Mike Pence.\n\nWe can build a better America and make that shining city upon the hill bright again.\n\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless\u00a0America.\n\n", "I am here tonight not only as the Governor of New Jersey, but also as Donald Trump\u2019s friend for the last fourteen years.\n\nWe are about to be led by not only a strong leader but by a caring, genuine and decent person.\n\nI am proud to say that the voice of the people of our nation is being heard in this\n\nhall and those voices want Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States. But this election is not just about Donald Trump.\n\nIt is also about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nIn the past few weeks we have seen this Justice Department refuse to prosecute her.\n\nOver the last eight years, we have seen this Administration refuse to hold her accountable for her dismal record as Secretary of State.\n\nWell, tonight, as a former federal prosecutor, I welcome the opportunity to hold her accountable for her performance and her character.\n\nWe must present those facts to you, a jury of her peers, both in this hall and in living rooms around our nation.\n\nSince the Justice Department refuses to allow you to render a verdict, let\u2019s present the case now, on the facts, against Hillary Clinton. She was America\u2019s chief diplomat. Look around at the violence and danger in our world today every region of the world has been infected with her flawed judgment.\n\nBut let me be specific so you can render your verdict. In North Africa, she was the chief engineer of our disastrous overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.\n\nLibya today after Hillary Clinton\u2019s grand strategy? Libya\u2019s economy in ruins, death and violence in the streets and ISIS now dominating the country.\n\nHillary Clinton, as a failure for ruining Libya and creating a nest for terrorist activity by ISIS guilty or not guilty? In Nigeria, Hillary Clinton amazingly fought for two years to keep an Al-Qaeda affiliate off the terrorist watch list.\n\nWhat happened because of this reckless action by the candidate who is the self proclaimed champion of women around the world? These terrorists abducted hundreds of innocent young girls two years ago.\n\nThese schoolgirls are still missing today.\n\nWhat was the solution from the Obama/Clinton team? A hashtag campaign! Hillary Clinton, as an apologist for an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria resulting in the capture of innocent young women guilty or not guilty? She fights for the wrong people.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t fight for us. She doesn\u2019t get the real threats America faces. In China, Hillary Clinton praised the Chinese government for buying our debt to finance President Obama\u2019s bloated stimulus plan.\n\nSo desperate for Chinese cash, she promised to oppose the Buy American provision in the stimulus bill in exchange for the cash to finance his huge expansion of government spending.\n\nHillary Clinton, putting big government spending financed by the Chinese ahead of jobs for middle class Americans guilty or not guilty? In Syria, she called President Assad a \u201creformer\u201d and a \u201cdifferent kind of leader\u201d.\n\nWith 400,000 now dead\u2026think about that.\n\nFour.\n\nHundred.\n\nThousand. Dead.\n\nAt the hands of the man Hillary defended.\n\nWe must ask this question: Hillary Clinton, as an awful judge of the character of a dictator-butcher in the Middle Eastguilty or not guilty? In Iran, she led the negotiations that brought about the worst nuclear deal in history.\n\nLet me be clear: America and the world are measurably less safe and less respected because of the Iran deal Hillary helped cut.\n\nPeriod. After she launched those negotiations, she became the biggest cheerleader for it at the end.\n\nA deal that will lead to a nuclear Iran, an Israel that will be less safe and secure and much more dangerous Middle East.\n\nHillary Clinton, as an inept negotiator of the worst nuclear arms deal in American history guilty or not guilty? In Russia, she went to the Kremlin on her very first visit and gave them the symbolic reset button.\n\nThe button should have read, \u201cdelete\u201d she is very good at that because she deleted in four years what it took 40 years to build. The next year, she said our goal was to strengthen Russia.\n\nStrengthen an adversary led by a dictator who dreams of reassembling the old Soviet empire? What a dangerous lack of judgment.\n\nOnce again, as a flawed evaluator of dictators and failed strategist who has permitted Russia back in as a major player in the Middle East is Hillary Clinton guilty or not guilty? In Cuba, Hillary Clinton supported concessions to the Castro brothers and got almost nothing in return for ending the embargo.\n\nShe supported a deal that didn\u2019t even require this murderous regime to return a cop killer, JoAnne Chesimard, to face justice.\n\nChesimard murdered a New Jersey State Trooper in cold blood, fled to Cuba and lives there to this very day.\n\nHow do you live with your own conscience when you reward a domestic terrorist with continued safety and betray the family of fallen police officer waiting for decades for justice for his murder? Hillary Clinton as coddler of the brutal Castro brothers and betrayer of the family of fallen Trooper Werner Foerster guilty or not guilty?\n\nFinally, here at home, in one of her first decisions as Secretary of State, she set up a private e-mail server in her basement in violation of our national security.\n\nLets face it: Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she did about protecting America\u2019s secrets.\n\nThen she lied about it over and over again.\n\nShe said there was no marked classified information on her server.\n\nThe FBI Director said that was untrue.\n\nShe said that she did not email any classified information. The FBI Director said that was untrue.\n\nShe said all work related emails were sent back to the State Department.\n\nThe FBI Director said that was untrue.\n\nAs to Hillary Clinton, putting herself ahead of America guilty or not guilty? Hillary Clinton, lying to the American people about her selfish, awful judgment guilty or not guilty? Time after time the facts, and just the facts, lead you to the same verdict both around the world and at home.\n\nIn Libya and Nigeria guilty.\n\nIn China and Syria guilty.\n\nIn Iran and Russia and Cuba guilty.\n\nAnd here at home on risking America\u2019s secrets to keep her own and lying to cover it all upguilty. Her focus group tested persona, with no genuineness to be found, is a sham meant to obscure all the facts and leave you able to vote for her. We cannot promote someone to Commander-in-Chief who has made the world a more violent and dangerous place with every bad judgment she has made.\n\nWe cannot make the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the United Statessomeone who has risked America\u2019s secrets and lied about this to Congress and the American people.\n\nWe didn\u2019t disqualify Hillary Clinton to be President of the United States the facts of her life and career disqualifies her. We in this hall agree with all of this.\n\nBut I want to talk to all of you at home, in your living rooms. You are the ones who will decide this election. We have an alternative.\n\nWe have a man who is unafraid.\n\nWe have a man who wants to lead us.\n\nWe have a man who understands the frustrations and the aspirations of our fellow citizens.\n\nWe have a man who judges people based on their performance regardless of your gender, race, ethnic or religious background. We do not need to settle for less.\n\nWe cannot reward incompetence and deceit. We need to demand more than what Hillary Clinton offers for America.\n\nWe know exactly what four years of Hillary Clinton will bring: all the failures of the Obama years, but with less charm and more lies. It is our obligation to stop Hillary Clinton now and never let her within 10 miles of the White House again.\n\nIt is time to come together and make sure that Donald Trump is our next President.\n\nI am proud to be part of this team.\n\nNow let\u2019s go win this thing.\n\n", "Donald Trump is a man of vision: he isn\u2019t a wide eyed dreamer, but someone who sees what others don\u2019t, and turns that vision into reality, making life better for people and communities across the nation.\n\nI have experienced this firsthand at The Trump Winery and Hotel, which I manage.\n\nWhen Donald Trump purchased the winery in 2011 it was in receivership. Quickly and decisively he went to work: building the hotel, replanting vines, and making it a world class destination and the largest vineyard in\u00a0 Virginia.\n\nToday we directly employ more than 100 people and support countless other entrepreneurs, contractors, and suppliers throughout the region.\n\nWe generate millions in revenue and millions more in taxes, and have a regional economic impact of nearly $50 million a year which has further strengthened and sustained the community in which our employees and I live\n\nAt the winery the returns have been impressive, with nearly 100 percent sales growth in just five years. I\u2019ve not just seen this happen: I\u2019ve helped make it happen, and I can tell you it would not have happened without Donald Trump and his family.\n\nLet me be clear: it was not easy, and it was not inevitable.\n\nIt took a team of hard working, dedicated employees: but it takes more than hard work alone.\n\nOur success would not have come to pass without the leadership and the vision of the Trumps.\n\nYou often hear Donald Trump talk, but what you don\u2019t see is when he listens. He and his son Eric listen attentively and ask questions that lead to\u00a0engaged,\n\ninformed decisions based on the expert knowledge of those who have earned their trust.\n\nThat trust is rewarded not just with compensation but with authority and resources.\n\nThe Trumps have also given a gift to those who know them, an approach and an outlook to life by which will always guide me.\n\nBecause of them I now think bigger, and in ways I thought might not even be possible.\n\nDonald Trump has told me that a person\u2019s own work ethic and drive are the\u00a0 only limitations to success.\n\nI now believe that and know it to be true.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a platitude: at Trump Winery it is real, and I\u2019ll tell you it is\u00a0rare.\n\nIt\u2019s been accompanied by respect for my accomplishments, and the opportunity to develop and grow professionally.\n\nThat is a direct result of the Trumps\u2019 leadership: leadership that we now need more today, more than ever, in our country.\n\n", "Good evening. Let me start out with a question.\n\nAre there any Mountaineers in the audience tonight?\n\nI\u2019m Shelley Moore Capito \u2014 the first woman elected to serve the state of West Virginia in the United States Senate.\n\nLadies and gentlemen \u2014 we face challenging times. Times in which we as leaders must ask how we can secure a future \u2014 that\u2019s brighter for our next generation.\n\nThat\u2019s always the challenge of leadership.\n\nAnd this election is no different. But with every challenge comes great opportunity.\u00a0 And that opportunity is what I would like to speak about tonight.\n\nLet me first tell you where I come from \u2014 the Mountain State. I\u2019m a life-long West Virginian.\n\nWith our tight knit communities \u2014 our state is just one big small\u00a0town.\n\nThat\u2019s never been more evident than in this past month as West Virginia was ravaged by flooding \u2014 that upended communities \u2014 displaced families \u2014 and claimed 23 lives.\n\nAs I traveled the flood zones \u2014 I was inspired by people who \u2014 despite losing everything \u2014 sought ways to help and serve others. The stories are tragic but uplifting \u2014 and I am so proud of my state.\n\nIn their jobs and communities \u2014 West Virginians work hard and deliver results. And \u2014 in turn \u2014 they expect our country\u2019s elected leaders to do the\u00a0 same.\n\nThe constant refrain I hear back home \u2014 is to stop the bickering \u2014 improve\u00a0 the economy \u2014 and fight for jobs.\n\nLet me tell you something \u2014 they\u2019re right.\n\nThe greatest obstacle for West Virginia families \u2014 and families all across America over the past eight years \u2014 has been a president that places left-wing priorities and campaign promises over their livelihoods.\n\nPresident Obama has hurt the heart and soul of my state \u2014 our proud coal miners and the communities where they live \u2014 work \u2014 and pursue\u00a0 happiness.\n\nHis policies have ripped through the heartland \u2014 creating a cycle of pessimism and disgust.\n\nPeople around the country feel the Obama Administration has kicked them to the curb with a callousness that\u2019s damaged their ability to trust and respect government.\n\nIn 2008 \u2014 President Obama famously said \u2014 \u201cIf somebody wants to build a coal- powered plant \u2014 they can.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that it will bankrupt\u00a0 them.\u201d\n\nEight years later \u2014 it\u2019s safe to say that his actions match his\u00a0words.\n\nHe\u2019s never realized that when you bankrupt a coal company \u2014 you deprive communities of their livelihood.\n\nHis recklessness has cost more than 60,000 coal workers their jobs since 2011. That\u2019s 60,000 families who are now without work \u2014 without a paycheck \u2014 and without options.\n\nNot to be outdone \u2014 Hillary Clinton has already promised \u2014 \u201cto put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d\n\nShe wants to put thousands more Americans out of work.\n\nShe has promised to devastate communities and families across coal\u00a0country.\n\nWhen I think about Hillary Clinton\u2019s pursuit of an anti-coal agenda \u2014 I think about the miner who wakes up before dawn for another ten-hour\u00a0shift.\n\nI think about the bus driver who drives the miners\u2019 children to school. I think about the nurse who cares for the retired\u00a0 miners.\n\nI think about the loan officer at the community bank.\u00a0And I think about the hundreds of coal equipment distributors.\n\nI weep for the fabric of my state.\n\nThese men and women take pride in their highly skilled \u2014 and good paying jobs that provide for their families and support their\u00a0 communities.\n\nThey work tirelessly to power America.\n\nWest Virginia workers are the backbone of this country.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton is proudly promising to put them out of work? Now \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by this.\n\nBecause Hillary Clinton understands coal miners and blue-collar workers \u2014 about as well as she understands secure email.\n\nA day in the life of a coal miner \u2014 and a day in the life of Hillary Clinton \u2014 could not be more different.\n\nFor over 25 years \u2014 she\u2019s thrived in a world where the rules bend to her. Recently we learned she showed \u201cextreme carelessness\u201d with our nation\u2019s secrets.\n\nFor others \u2014 the consequences of misusing classified information have\u00a0 been swift and serious.\n\nNot for Hillary Clinton.\n\nMust be nice to have your husband stop in for a friendly chat with the Attorney General on a tarmac during the final days of an FBI\u00a0 investigation.\n\nSince the end of her husband\u2019s administration \u2014 she\u2019s profited from closed-door speeches with fees that could buy homes in West Virginia.\n\nNot only is she out of touch \u2014 her attempts to reach out to the American people often reveal how distorted her reality has become.\n\nIn another story from the tarmac \u2014 detailing the harrowing tale of Hillary\u2019s 1996 trip to Bosnia.\n\nShe recalled that they \u2014 \u201clanded under sniper fire\u201d \u2014 and had to run for cover. But the tape told a very different story.\n\nThere were no snipers or hostile forces.\n\nHillary was greeted by a young girl \u2014 who\u2019d written a poem about peace.\n\nWhat I find most troubling is that Hillary Clinton \u2014 fails to recognize that her calculated policies affect real people.\n\nThose who want to feed their families \u2014 own homes \u2014 pay for college \u2014 and pursue the American Dream.\n\nThese goals should not and cannot fall out of reach.\n\nYou may remember \u2014 when President Obama arrogantly proclaimed that he would slow the rise of the oceans \u2014 and heal our planet.\n\nHe introduced and implemented sweeping environmental regulations without\n\nCongress\u2019 approval \u2014 and without considering the economy.\n\nThese unilateral actions are ill informed \u2014 unconstitutional \u2014 and \u2014 un- American.\n\nRight now the burden of government regulations in this country amounts to roughly $15,000 a household.\n\nLet me ask you a couple of questions \u2014 are you\u00a0 ready?\n\nIs burdening every household in America with a cost of $15,000 \u2014 worth more applause lines at campaign rallies?\n\nIs burdening every household in America with a cost of $15,000 \u2014 worth more campaign cash?\n\nIs burdening every household in America with a cost of $15,000 \u2014 worth a few more one-liners?\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure you agree with me about the importance of this\u00a0 election.\n\nOne of the many reasons this election is so important \u2014 is that the Democrats have nominated a candidate that Americans overwhelming\u00a0 distrust.\n\nShe\u2019s earned this reputation.\n\nHer term at the State Department was shrouded in scandal and\u00a0 mistrust.\n\nA few weeks ago we watched as the FBI Director called Secretary Clinton \u201cnegligent.\u201d He questioned her judgment and revealed countless ways she has misled the American people.\n\nHillary Clinton should be repentant \u2014 or at least humbled by this \u2014 but she\u2019s not.\n\nWe know that the cornerstone of our global leadership is not just our\u00a0 awesome military \u2014 it\u2019s not just our economic power \u2014 but our credibility.\n\nShe\u2019s squandered Americans\u2019 trust.\n\nThankfully \u2014 the latest misdeed hasn\u2019t slipped past the attention of the American people.\n\nRecent polls showed that voters\u2019 distrust of Hillary was deteriorating her support. So it comes down to trust.\n\nShe can\u2019t be trusted with classified information \u2014 or trusted to play by the same rules as you and me.\n\nAnd \u2014 without trust \u2014 we cannot feel safe and thrive.\n\nNo one who has lost the trust of the American people can serve as\u00a0 President.\n\nThe only thing we can trust Hillary to do is double down on the same failed Obama policies that are hurting Americans.\n\nBut who knows maybe she\u2019ll feel compelled to pursue the dangerous policies of the socialist wing of her party \u2014 which gave her so much trouble this\u00a0 spring.\n\nWe know she will double down on an economic agenda \u2014 that\u2019s led to the lowest workforce participation in decades.\n\nWe know she will double down on the war on coal. We know that she will double down on Obamacare.\n\nWe know that she will double down on far-left Supreme Court nominees \u2014 who act like appointed legislators \u2014 not as guardians of the\u00a0 Constitution.\n\nWe know that she will double down on the catastrophic foreign policy she herself orchestrated.\u00a0 Which has emboldened enemies \u2014 weakened alliances \u2014\u00a0 and increased risks to our national security.\n\nThe contrast between our vision for the future \u2014- and that of the Hillary Clinton is clear.\n\nNow is the time to turn the tide.\n\nLet\u2019s turn the tide. So that unelected bureaucrats no longer mandate regulations that are disconnected from the realities of working\u00a0 Americans.\n\nLet\u2019s turn the tide. From an executive who promotes a radical environmental agenda that will raise costs across the country.\n\nLet\u2019s turn the tide. From a Washington that tells us who our doctors should be \u2014 and delivers a lower quality of care.\n\nLet\u2019s turn the tide. To a government that respects the Constitution \u2014 and protects the jobs and way of life in rural America.\n\nThis is not out of reach.\u00a0 We can make these visions a reality.\n\nThis week we\u2019ll officially nominate a candidate \u2014- who received the most primary votes in the history of our party. A candidate who understands how to create jobs and grow the economy.\n\nWith Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans leading Congress, Our party wants to allow businesses to create jobs \u2014 not regulate jobs out of existence.\n\nOur party understands the free market and doesn\u2019t try to control\u00a0 it.\n\nOur party protects and stands up for hardworking Americans \u2014 like West Virginia coal miners.\n\nOur party will strengthen our military \u2014 to face growing\u00a0 threats.\n\nTo ensure our country gets the elected leaders it deserves \u2014 we must carry this momentum to elect Donald Trump \u2014 who speaks directly to rural Americans who have been devastated by the Obama Administration.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 West Virginians know he understands their problems \u2014 shares their concerns \u2014 and is going to do things differently.\n\nThe American people know that Hillary Clinton has forfeited her trust and has broken her bond with working Americans.\n\nLet\u2019s commit to bringing our country together. In the months ahead \u2014 the stakes are both clear and high.\n\nTake the energy from this convention back to your state \u2014 back to your home \u2014 and work to elect Donald Trump, who will make America great\u00a0again.\n\nThank you.\n\n", "I devoted my career to studying and operating on the brain. This remarkable organ defines our humanity.\n\nIt gives us the ability not only to feel and observe, but also to reason. When deciding who to elect as our next president, we owe it to ourselves and our country to make use of this power of reason to evaluate the character, experience, and intentions of the candidates and make an informed decision.\n\nWe must resist the temptation to take the easy way out and passively accept what is fed to us by the media or the political\u00a0 elite.\n\nOne of the most dangerous narratives being advanced by some in our own party is the notion that however dreadful a Hillary Clinton administration may be, the effects will be temporary or harmless\u2026.\n\nConsider what she already has done in office. Classified information was recklessly\u00a0revealed.\n\nIntelligence officers were exposed. An ambassador and three other American patriots were slaughtered. That kind of harm is irreversible. It is absurd to think\u00a0 we can ask our enemies to disregard those emails or leave our operatives alone. And unfortunately, we cannot resurrect the dead.\n\nNow consider what Hillary will do if elected president.\n\nShe will appoint justices to the Supreme Court who share her liberal view of an expansive government that is entitled to trample fundamental\u00a0 freedoms.\n\nThe decisions of a Court dominated by Obama-Clinton appointees will effectively set her cancerous policies in stone.\n\nShe will perpetuate a system that traps our children in failing schools and promotes poverty instead of empowerment.\n\nThis type of malignant neglect leaves indelible scars on these children and gaping wounds in our communities.\n\nThe question before us is not whether we should elect a Republican or a Democrat as president of the United States.\n\nThe question we must answer is whether we want to retain the ideals upon which this country was founded or succumb to Hillary Clinton\u2019s new world order that places government in control of every aspect of our\u00a0 lives.\n\nDonald Trump understands this very well. He understands that the blessings of this nation come with the responsibility to ensure that they are available to all, not just the privileged few.\n\nThis is exemplified by his willingness to take on the establishment against all odds.\n\nIt is evident in his passion for the American worker.\n\nIt is found in his desire to put his considerable skills to work on behalf of American interests, not self-interest.\n\nI am proud to support Donald Trump \u2014 the extraordinary businessman and the right leader for our time.\n\n", "Good evening. Many of you may know me from one of your favorite soap operas, The Young & the Restless, the Bold & the Beautiful, and many other television shows and films.\n\nBut, since we only have One Life to Live \u2014 and yes, I had to throw that in \u2014 I decided to follow other dreams.\n\nI\u2019m now an avocado grower for all of you guacamole lovers out there. I also run and operate my own design business.\n\nAnd, with my husband, Gary \u2013 we just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary \u2014 Gary and I are partners running a sport fishing business, retail operations, rental operations and assorted other enterprises.\n\nLike millions of women across our nation, I have many\u00a0responsibilities.\n\nAnd, because we women have many roles in our lives, I am offended when the media and the Democrats type-cast us a single-issue\u00a0 voters.\n\nWe take care of our families, work inside AND outside the home, pay the bills, manage the costs at home, take care of our parents \u2013 all focused on one thing: securing the future of our families.\n\nLike so many parents today, I have great concerns about the direction of our country and what it means for the future of my children.\n\nAnd, I can\u2019t let this election pass by without doing my part in helping get us back on the right track. That is why I\u2019m so grateful and honored to be here with you tonight.\n\nWhen I look back at my grandparents and my Mom and Dad, I realize that so much of their lives were devoted to one goal: helping me, my sister Tammy\u00a0 and brother Chris have every opportunity to succeed. I was always told by my Grandmother I could do anything I put my mind to and I did. I\u2019ve worked very hard.\n\nWe have started businesses that have succeeded (and still do) and we have had ventures that have not.\u00a0 We have created jobs and even more tax dollars.\u00a0 We have worked 80 hour weeks and have gone without pay checks to keep\u00a0 employees paid.\n\nThis is not unique to Gary and me. It is the story of every small business owner in America.\n\nI am a member of California\u2019s Business Women for Trump. We\u2019re comprised of farmers, doctors, small business owners, attorneys, and women in just about\u00a0 every field, profession, race and ethnicity.\n\nAnd, we\u2019re concerned about out-of-control, unreasonable government regulations that needlessly add costs to doing business and tie us ALL up in red\u00a0tape.\n\nAnd, don\u2019t get me started about a bewildering tax code and high taxes to boot. This isn\u2019t true just for small businesses but for farming as\u00a0well.\n\nJust this past week, our business is confronting a problem caused by Obamacare.\n\nWhat a shock!\n\nAs a small business we used to offer medical insurance to our employees and, for those who chose to be covered, we paid most of their\u00a0 premiums.\n\nThis quarter we had several employees work over the 30 hour threshold set by Obamacare and, by the requirements of the law, they must sign up for one of the approved health care plans.\n\nOur younger employees don\u2019t understand why they are getting forced off of their previous plan which was significantly more affordable and tailored to their needs. Most of our employees are college-age and healthy. Yet they are required to buy coverage that does not meet their needs and is too expensive for their\u00a0 wallets.\n\nOne good thing; It has been a wake-up call to our young employees. They all are voting Republican this year!\n\nOne third of small businesses are owned by women. To the 9.4 million women business owners who employ about 8 million workers \u2013 a value of about $1.5 trillion dollars to our economy \u2014 I urge you to think about how important this election is for your future.\n\nWho do you think better understands your challenges and will stand with you fighting for a better economy and more opportunities? \u2014\n\nA career Washington-insider who only knows how to use your tax dollars for more government jobs. And, incidentally, ladies, both in then Senator Clinton\u2019s office and the Clinton Foundation, men have been better paid than women.\n\nOr a successful businessman who knows how to make a payroll, who\u00a0 understands the special challenges women business owners face, such as gaining access to needed capital, and who has an admirable record of hiring and promoting women in his businesses?\n\nFor a moment, I would like to touch on an issue that Donald has spoken about from the beginning of his campaign: trade.\n\nAs an actress and a farmer\u2013 did you ever expect to see those words in the same sentence \u2013 I\u2019ve seen first hand the impact of high taxes, over-regulation, and suspect trade deals.\n\nI have seen tv and movie productions move out of the country.\u00a0 If you were\u00a0an\n\n\u201cA\u201d lister like Leonardo DiCaprio or an owner of a studio, you were okay. But, if you were a cameraman, sound tech, boom operator or did any one of the many jobs in a production, you were out of luck.\n\nAt the time, it did not affect me and I didn\u2019t understand what my local union boys were talking about. Now I do and I\u2019m sorry for not understanding the plight of these men and women who lost their livelihoods. And they did.\n\nAs an avocado grower, I have faced the impact of our trade policies. I\u2019ve seen first-hand our domestic market flooded with imports that harmed local farmers and even drove some out of business. My neighbors who have raised this product for years are being forced to cut down their groves.\n\nI\u2019ll leave decisions about trade policies and how you balance the many economic interests of our nation to others but this much I do know: Donald Trump raised concerns on behalf of working people before the Washington elites did. He will\u00a0 make trade deals that benefit working men and women and their families right here in America!\n\nThere will be a time, and I hope soon, for a woman President. And, why not? As Donald has said, a good woman is worth ten men.\n\nWe have so many outstanding women in the Congress and in our state and local governments who are ready for the job now or in the near\u00a0 future.\n\nBut, let\u2019s be clear: the Democrats offer up a woman who when she had a chance to stand up for women, did not do so.\n\nInstead, she attacked women, denigrated them, called them liars. I personally know victims and they find Hilary\u2019s actions and remarks\u00a0 repulsive!!\n\nHer comments are comments of convenience.\n\nIf we are to prosper as a nation, if we are going to grow the economy and create jobs, we need a leader who will go to Washington and shake things\u00a0 up.\n\nA president who will bring common sense to regulations and eliminate unnecessary ones. Who will fix our tax system.\n\nWho will start us on the path to rebuild our\u00a0infrastructure.\n\nWe need someone who knows how to build things! Who knows how to create jobs!\n\nWho knows how to negotiate!\n\nWho will tackle problems head on, so we can have true\u00a0progress!\n\nSince it was announced that I was speaking to you tonight, I have been attacked in social media with all kinds of outrageous insults, none of which are even remotely true.\n\nThe Left wants to silence those they disagree with. In politics, on college campuses, in business.\n\nThis must stop.\u00a0 I will not stand by idly.\n\nIt is time we stood up for ourselves, for Donald Trump and for our country.\u00a0 Donald is the most qualified man in America to turn things around in Washingtonand our nation.\n\nSo I ask you to join me and California\u2019s Business Women for Trump in supporting America\u2019s best opportunity to return to greatness.\n\nDonald Trump, the next President of the United States. Thank you.\n\nClinton/Kaine: 228\n\nTrump/Pence: 290\n\nDemocrats: 48*(+2)\n\nRepublicans: 52(-2)\n\nDemocrats: 193(+6)\n\nRepublicans: 238(-6)\n\n", "This evening, Gov. Scott will speak about the recent terrorist attack in Orlandoand the growing worldwide threat of Islamic extremism.\u00a0 Gov. Scott will emphasize that putting America first will help keep Americans safe.\u00a0\n\nMy name is Rick Scott, Governor of the great state of Florida.\n\nBefore I begin\u00a0tonight, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who has kept us in their prayers after the horrific and hate-filled terrorist attack in Orlando a month ago. We have received an outpouring of support and love from Americans everywhere. The American people do stick up for each other. On behalf of the state of Florida: thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\nI\u2019m old enough to remember when terrorism was something that happened in foreign countries. Not today. How many more times does the evil of radical Islamic terrorism have to occur, before the President of the United States will muster the courage to face the truth? How many more \u201cOrlandos,\u201d \u201cSan Bernadinos,\u201d or \u201cFt. Hoods\u201d will happen until President Obama decides to be honest? I cried with the grieving moms and dads and brothers and sisters of the 49 people slaughtered by an ISIS-inspired terrorist. This war is real. It is here in America. And the next President must destroy this evil.\n\nDonald Trump is the man for that job.\n\nI met Donald about 20 years ago, before either of us ever ran for office. Let me tell you why this is the time for Donald to be President. A lot of politicians like to give speeches where they say \u201cwe are at a crossroads.\u201d But that\u2019s not really where we are. Today, America is in terrible world-record-high debt, our economy is not growing, our jobs are going overseas, we\u2019ve allowed our military to decay, and we project weakness on the international stage. Washington grows while the rest of America struggles. The Democrats have not led us to a crossroads, they have led us to a cliff.\n\nI know that some have reservations about my friend Donald Trump. Perhaps he\u2019s sometimes not polite. He can be a little rough. And he may be too direct. But, this election is not actually about Donald Trump, or Hillary Clinton. In fact, this election is not about you or me either. This election is about the very survival of the American Dream.\n\nIt\u2019s time for all Americans to put down the partisan banners, vote for the survival of the greatest country in the world, and do what is right for our country \u2013 Vote for Donald Trump!\n\nFinally, I have some great news. This is the time America has been waiting for. This year, we get to fire the politicians! And who better to let the politicians inWashington know \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d than Donald Trump?\n\nWe need a president who is politically incorrect and will tell it like it is. We need a President who isn\u2019t afraid of Washington. We need a President who doesn\u2019t believe government is the answer to every problem. We need a President who recognizes that great countries have borders. We need a President who will bring American jobs back to America. We need a President who is not afraid to say \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d And we need a President who will wipe ISIS off the face of the earth.\n\nAnd on every one of these measures Hillary Clinton fails. America is worth fighting for. Let\u2019s make America great again. Let\u2019s elect Donald Trump the next President of the United States.\n\n", "Ingraham will discuss the importance of respect for the Constitution, the rule of law, and the inherent rights of the\u00a0American people the first priority of our elected officials.\n\nYou may know me from TV and radio, but my kids know me by my most important name, Mom. I\u2019m a single mother of three adopted children. I\u2019m here tonight supporting Donald Trump because like most Americans, I refuse to leave them a country that is worse off than the one my parents left me.\n\nMy grandparents were Polish immigrants. My parents grew up in Depression Era New England. My dad enlisted in the Navy in WWII. My mom waited tables until she was 73.\u00a0 My dad worked at his car wash. They flew the flag at our house and not just on the 4th of July. They scrimped and saved. My mother made my clothes, and wore the same winter coat for 40 years. Any extra money went into the bank for our education. We learned the dignity found in a job well done. My brothers picked tobacco and delivered newspapers. I picked blueberries and raked lawns.\u00a0You see, my parents didn\u2019t believe there were jobs Americans wouldn\u2019t do. In the early \u201970s, watching the news with my mother, I asked her why people were burning the American flag. She answered: \u201cBecause their parents didn\u2019t teach them about respect.\u201d\n\nRespect. We see it in decline once again. The people don\u2019t respect the government.\u00a0 The government doesn\u2019t respect the people, not even our veterans. Politicians don\u2019t respect the Constitution. Many don\u2019t respect the life of the infant in the womb, or the elderly who languish alone. Others don\u2019t respect the police, who risk their lives every day to protect us. Many in public office don\u2019t enforce or respect the rule of law. Isn\u2019t that right, Mrs. Clinton? Too many citizens and non-citizens don\u2019t respect our laws either. And many of our allies don\u2019t respect us anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see this happen to the country we love. This is our home. It belongs to us, our children and our grandchildren. We deserve better and we can do better. Like us, Donald Trump understands that we must turn this around and restore respect across all levels of society. Unlike us, Hillary Clinton believes the status quo is just fine because she helped create it.\n\nDonald Trump knows that a nation without borders is not a nation at all. Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t believe in borders. Donald Trump knows that a country must put the interests of its own people first. Hillary Clinton thinks that America is just another nation in a global order. Donald Trump understands that America\u2019s greatness comes from her people, her freedom. Hillary Clinton believes greatness can only be found in an ever-growing government that only Her Majesty rules. She believes that there\u2019s a government solution to every problem. No, Hillary, you\u2019re the problem. And Donald Trump is the solution.\n\nWe were in a mess back in 1979, too. Only then it was leisure suits instead of pants suits. Many believed America\u2019s time was up. But then Ronald Reaganarrived just in time to restore our national confidence, our economy and our military.\n\nDonald Trump will do the same. He has pledged to work tirelessly to get our country back on track. We should all, even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos, pledge to support Donald Trump now. This is the most important election since 1980. We see stagnating wages, skyrocketing healthcare costs, doubling of the debt, the threat of ISIS, the rise of China. And the Democrats\u2019 answer is to nominate someone who helped orchestrate the decline? It has to be a cruel joke.\n\nI don\u2019t want to sit around and tell my kids stories about how great America used to be. Do you? We never give up. We rise to challenges. We fight and win. We\u2019re Americans. We need a president who believes in the Constitution and who will fight for us and with us.\n\nTo all my friends in the press, you know in your heart why Donald Trump won the nomination. It\u2019s because he dared to call out the phonies, the frauds, and the corruption that have all gone unexposed, and that you failed to challenge for far too long. Donald Trump respects us enough to tell us the hard truths about what has happened to our country \u2013 on issues like immigration, trade, and our diminished status around the world \u2013 even in the face of unfair criticism and sheer hatred.\n\nThey had their chance. Now, it\u2019s our chance. Let\u2019s reject the politics of division. Let\u2019s defeat the Clinton Machine. Let\u2019s send the consultants and lobbyists packing. Let\u2019s give the power back to the people. And let\u2019s elect Donald Trump President of the United Sates.\n\n", "Ruffin will speak about his personal experience working with Donald Trump\u00a0as a developer, entrepreneur, innovator, and leader.\n\nI\u2019ve known Donald Trump as a friend and a business partner for over 20 years. You can\u2019t be my friend and my business partner for long if you\u2019re not honest with me, and good to your word.\u00a0 I can tell you Donald Trump is both.\n\nHe\u2019s been an innovator and an entrepreneur: no one in our business works harder, or smarter, than he does. Professionally I have seen time and again how he can see what others cannot, and how he has taken properties others took a pass on and made something incredible out of them.\n\nAs a result of his vision and hard work he has put tens of thousands of our fellow\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Americans to work, created amazing spaces and places, and made money for himself, and his partners. He has done this in many of our nation\u2019s greatest cities such as: Chicago, New York, Miami, and Las Vegas.\n\nLet me tell you about one of the deals we did together. About ten years ago, he and I developed Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. As with so many Trump properties, this has innovative design, and attention to detail. Buyers liked it, and it seemed it would be another tremendous success: it was under budget and on time, however, in 2008 the recession hit, and the banks would not finance any additional units. This left us with about 75 percent unsold, and more than a half billion dollars in debt. Ninety-nine percent of people and investors would have walked away: Donald would not give up.\n\nHe is a fighter, and he saw its incredible potential.\n\nI believed in him, and for three tough years we worked together to keep it afloat. Through it all, Donald always paid his bills promptly, with no discounts.\n\nDue to Donald\u2019s persistence and faith, and my faith in him, we turned it around. Today it has become a huge success.\n\nThis is just one example.\n\nI have seen him do this time and time again.\n\nHe has put money on the line, both his and mine. He is a developer. He is an entrepreneur. He is an innovator. And he is a leader.\n\nHe now wants to turn around Washington. When he first told me he was going to run for President, I told him I did not think it was a good idea.\n\nI asked him why he wanted to do this, and he simply replied, \u201cI love America.\n\nOur system is broken, and I am going to fix it.\u201d\n\nThis is the Donald I know, and I know what America needs now: a fighter and an innovator.\n\nHe sees the potential and he knows what our great country can be if we come together.\n\nDonald Trump will fix what is broken in Washington, and Make America Great Again, and you can bet on that.\n\n", "Bondi will speak about the importance of restoring the rule of law after\u00a0eight years of living under an administration that has played fast and loose with our constitutional rights.\n\nNovember 8th is a day of reckoning for all those who have abused their power.\n\nIt is the day that we the people will take back our government.\n\nFrom Washington bureaucrats playing doctor with our health care.\n\nTo a President who\u2019s been playing fast and loose with our constitutional rights and Russian roulette with our borders.\n\nNovember 8th, is when America feels safe again, when America wins again.\n\nBecause winning this election means reclaiming something to which I\u2019ve dedicated my entire career: the rule of law.\n\nLaws that make our neighborhoods safe, and our economy strong. Laws that apply equally to everyone.\n\nLaws that back our law enforcement, now more than ever, because they have our backs.\n\nBut today, these laws are under siege by a President determined to ignore laws he doesn\u2019t like, and by a former Secretary of State who believes the laws don\u2019t apply to her.\n\nBy the way, she also deserves no security clearance. This lawlessness must stop.\n\nDonald Trump will stop it.\n\nHe\u2019ll roll back Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive orders.\n\nHe\u2019ll enforce immigration laws to keep us safe, while allowing legal immigrants to bless this nation with their talents and their dreams. He\u2019ll take control of our borders, because we must stop the flow of cocaine and heroin coming into our country and killing our kids.\n\nThen there\u2019s this. Hillary believes our enemies deserve our respect and empathy.Donald Trump believes terrorists deserve to die.\n\nHillary will stack the Supreme Court with liberal justices who will allow government to continue its rampage against our individual rights, with utter contempt for our Second Amendment.\n\nI know Donald. He will appoint conservative justices who will defend, rather than rewrite, our Constitution.\n\nAre you ready to send ISIS a message that we\u2019re really coming after them?\n\nWhen Donald Trump is President, he will.\n\nOn November 8th, remember this:\n\nIf you believe in limited government\u2026\n\nIf you believe in our historic constitutional rights\u2026\n\nIf you believe in the rule of law\u2026\n\nIf you believe it\u2019s time for America to start acting like America again\u2026\n\nThere is only one choice in this election: Donald Trump.\n\nAmerica\u2019s for Trump.\u00a0And so am I.\n\n", "Collins will issue a call to once again make America first in space exploration.\n\nFrom the moment the first Pilgrims arrived on our shores, Americans have been asking, \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d We are a nation built by the passion of people who weren\u2019t afraid to do something first, to step into the unknown, and pave our own way forward. We are a nation of explorers.\n\nIn 1961, President Kennedy issued a challenge to America: to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. 47 years ago on this very day, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin answered that call and walked on the moon. They took with them an American flag and a plaque bearing the inscription: \u201chere men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969. We came in peace for all mankind.\u201d\n\nWe landed on the moon to fulfill a leadership challenge and to explore. Exploration leads to innovation and discovery. Our successful robotic missions to Mars, Jupiter, and Pluto have provided valuable new information about our own planet.\n\nBut in 2011, the space shuttle program ended. The last time the US launched our own astronauts from our own soil was over 5 years ago. We must do better than that!\n\nCountries that are strong explore, invent, and discover to remain resilient in a changing world. I am honored to have played a role in our nation\u2019s heritage of explorers as the first woman to command a space shuttle mission, joining the ranks of those that have fought to lead the way.\n\nWe are all so proud of our Apollo program that put our astronauts on the Moon: first, in peace, for all mankind. Nations that lead on the frontier, lead in the world. We need that visionary leadership again. Leadership that will inspire the next generation to have that same passion.\n\nWe need leadership that will challenge every American to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d We need leadership that will make America\u2019s space program first again. We need leadership that will make America first again. That leader is Donald Trump.\n\nThank you and God bless the United States of America!\n\n", "Van Etten will speak about making America first by supporting the next generation of\u00a0American entrepreneurs.\n\nI was born an entrepreneur, by six years old I knew it.\n\nMy dream was to be a circus performer so I decided to have a circus at my house. I made tickets, sold them door to door, I even dressed my baby brother as a clown and taught my dog new tricks. I was ready for my big day.\n\nWhen people started arriving, my parents had no idea about the circus taking place. Embarrassed, they refunded money to my guests and apologized. I was so upset. Afterwards my dad sat me down and told me any dream you have is possible as long as you\u2019re willing to do the work it takes to get the job done. Then he added, \u201cafter you go to college.\u201d\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t wait. Taking my dad\u2019s advice, I partnered with the neighborhood kids to be part of my circus, and we charged our parents to watch the show. We continued to have our Circus show for over a year. My dad told me I earned great candy money that year!\n\nFast forward 26 years. Planning for my 20th high school reunion, I decided to check out the girls I went to school with. What I noticed was that my girlfriends looked like Barbies and drove BMWs.\u00a0 I was 30 pounds overweight, a stay at home mom and drove a minivan.\n\nI decided I needed a change. I began to dream again. I took a leap of faith and started my own network marketing business from home. Like many people who pursue a dream, I had to learn how to fail forward and never quit.\n\nI also had to become the type of person I wanted in my business. Within just two years, my husband was able to retire from 28 years at DOD. Jim Van Etten now homeschools our kids because we choose not to subject them to Common Core.\n\nI opened a fashion studio called MV House of Style in Brandon, Florida. Today I run a thriving multi-faceted business. I am living the American Dream.\n\nBut that dream is in jeopardy. My fear is that the next generation \u2013 the millennial \u2013 who over half of them have an entrepreneurial spirit and want to be their own boss \u2013 will not be able to because of the liberal policies that have been implemented over the past eight years.These policies \u2013 including higher taxes and excessive regulations \u2013 are crushing the American Dream.\n\nSmall businesses are the backbone of the American economy.\n\nWe need these entrepreneurs.\n\nWe live in the land of opportunity.\n\nWe need to protect the American Dream above all else.\n\nAre we willing to let government bureaucrats and liberal policies destroy the innovative spirit?If not, then we have to take action.\n\nWe need a president who is businessman not a Hillary-crat.\n\nWho understands small businesses are the backbone of America. Who will not raise taxes.Who will repeal Obamacare so small businesses can start offering insurance to their employees again.\n\nWho will end Common Core and protect our children\u2019s education. Who will encourage creativity and innovation. Who will bring manufacturing back to America. Who will make America great and safe again.\n\nThere is only one man capable of this juggling act.\u00a0 Only one man who can take the circus we\u2019ve inherited from the last eight years and serve as the ultimate ringmaster.\n\nThere is only one man who can preserve and protect the American Dream for future generations.\n\nThat man is Donald Trump. Thank you.\n\n", "Alvarado will speak about his parents legally immigrating to American and growing up watching them sacrifice every day to provide a better life for their family.\u00a0 Alvarado will emphasize that by\u00a0protecting the American dream for the next generation, we can make America first again.\n\nFrom the great Commonwealth of Kentucky, the home of horses, bourbon, coal, bluegrass, and the finest people on earth, allow me to express my sincerest appreciation and gratitude for the privilege of addressing this assembly.\n\nI am proud to stand before you tonight as the first Hispanic member ever elected to the Kentucky General Assembly. But, the road here was not an easy one. Three failed political runs were lonely at times and full of adversity. But, with a lot of determination, grit, and hard work, I triumphed.\n\nEverything I am and have achieved, I owe to God and my parents. My father was a proud legal immigrant from Costa Rica, my mother from Argentina. Being the son of immigrants, I saw firsthand their sacrifice to provide our family a better life.\n\nI watched their struggle in mastering a second language and their strong and quiet commitment to hard work. We didn\u2019t have the luxuries that other families had, but what my parents did give me was family structure, discipline, support, high personal expectations, love and faith in God. They were Hispanic, they were Americans and they were very proud of being both.\n\nThey understood the value of preserving our culture and our language, but also the value of an education and instilling a pride and love for our country.\n\nLike most immigrants, they understood that their sacrifice would not provide them immediate success, but the reward would be in the opportunity and success of their children and grandchildren.\n\nBut, this story is not unique to my family; it is the story of many legal Latino immigrants who come to America.\u00a0At their core, Hispanics believe what Republicans believe: traditional family values, church, faith in God, the dignity of work, and the opportunity for self-sufficiency that comes from a free society and a limited government.\n\nThey have simple dreams that might seem mundane to the average American, but would sound familiar to our founding fathers and their core principles.\n\nSome flee corrupt government leaders for the dream of liberty and freedom. Some flee crime and anarchy for the dream of safer communities for their families.\n\nSome flee hunger and despair for the dream of opportunity, entrepreneurship, and abundance.\n\nBut, all leave their homelands for the dream of America \u2013 the place where if you work hard, study hard, and obey our laws, you can accomplish anything.\n\nOver the past eight years, our President and his apprentice, Hillary Clinton, have talked about that American dream, but they have absolutely no idea how to protect it, foster it, or expand it.\u00a0Today, we have a President who has not only failed to end racial tension, he has made us more divided than ever.\n\nToday, we have a President who is itching to restrict our fundamental rights, such as religious liberty, the right to bear arms, and free speech.\n\nToday, we have a President who has rejected honesty and transparency, lying to the American people over and over again: from Obamacare to the promise of immigration reform to Fast and Furious to phone record spying to an IRS enemies list to green energy crony bankruptcies to Benghazi \u2013 to the VA scandal, to the Iran nuclear deal, the list goes on and on.\n\nAnd, with Hillary Clinton, this eight year nightmare will get far, far worse.\n\nAmericans face an important decision. Do we want someone who is brutally honest (perhaps to a fault) or do we want someone who is brutally dishonest? It is not a decision about America moving left or right, but it is a decision about America going up or down.\n\nBy protecting the American dream, we can make America first again.\n\nThere is only one candidate who will protect it for our current and future generations.\n\nThat candidate is Donald Trump.\n\nAnd now a message for my Latino friends:\n\nA mis hermanos hispanos: nuestras familias se fugaron le paises llenos de corrupcion y politicos mentirosos.\n\nPor favor, no permitan que esa miseria occura en este pais tambi\u00e9n.\n\nVivimos en una isla de libertad y opportunidad.\n\nVoten conmigo.\n\nVoten Republicano.\n\nY voten for Donald Trump.\n\nHillary Clinton, you failed the Hispanic community, and you don\u2019t deserve our vote.\n\nGod bless this convention and God bless this country.\n\n", "Dr. Scott will speak discuss Donald Trump\u2019s unique qualifications for the office of the presidency.\n\nI first met Donald Trump several years ago. He said he was very troubled about the direction our country was heading in. I listened to his vision, and I understood deeply, and shared many concerns he expressed. In the many times we have met since, we have spoken about the economy, race relations, immigration, jobs, urban renovation and revitalization, the military, and other issues that are critical to our nation\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nThe truth is Donald Trump is a conservative father and grandfather who feels his best days are in front, not behind him. Despite his accomplishments, he still feels a void, a need to serve his country and his fellow Americans.\n\nThe truth is, the Democratic Party has failed us: at home, our growth is lethargic and our debt deeper; we are spiritually empty; and we are more divided now than ever before. Abroad we are neither respected nor feared by our adversaries, and our friends increasingly cannot count on us. This is their legacy.\n\nWe need to make a sharp turn. We need to put into practice the great ideals and principles our country was founded on, and which are the source of strength that has made us great.\n\nThis is in our interest and the world\u2019s because the greater America is, the greater the entire world becomes. While some call Donald Trump a populist, I call him a patriot. That\u2019s because by definition a patriot is one who loves their country, supports its authority and its interests. Many liberals are embarrassed to use this word.\n\nMany believe we are a nation just like any other: we know we are not a nation like any other, and as Republicans we are unreservedly proud to be Americans and proud of our patriots!\n\nAmerica is a melting pot, a country of diversity: and we stand poised to make history: by standing together as Americans, by standing together as one. We are here as Americans regardless of race, creed, or color.\u00a0 We are here as those who hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and that we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\n\nDonald Trump will rebuild the broken trust that now exists between our citizens and our government which over the last eight years has brought the rhetoric of hope, but the reality of higher minority unemployment, crime, drug use, with more civil unrest and national distress.\n\nThis election is one of the most crucial elections in American history!\n\nDonald Trump has played for big stakes and is a master negotiator and dealmaker.\n\nHe knows that for all the sharp elbows and words that the art of the deal is bringing people together, to unify, to get to yes.\n\nThat means problem solving, finding common ground, and moving forward. He has done that for himself for over 30 years: he now wants to take that experience to get the best deal for America and for all Americans.\n\nI believe nothing will prevent Donald Trump from doing everything in his power to create an America that everyone can be proud of.\n\nHe believes, as do you and as I do, that we can become great again, and we can become strong again, if we have strong leadership. And I can think of no stronger leader who will place their left hand on a Bible that they believe in, raise their right hand and solemnly swear to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States of America than Donald J. Trump.\n\nGod bless Donald Trump, God Bless You, and God Bless America!\n\n", "Hamm will speak about how unleashing the full potential of America\u2019s vast energy resources will power America to greatness. Hamm will contrast this vast opportunity with Hillary Clinton\u2019s endeavor to crush America\u2019s energy renaissance at the behest of left wing radicals.\n\nThank you.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to be in Cleveland.\n\nFour years ago, Donald Trump asked me to tell him about the American Energy Renaissance and how we had transformed the North Dakota Bakken into the largest U.S. oil discovery ever. I told him it was moving America from energy scarcity to abundance, would change the world forever, and could power America to greatness once again. He wrote that down. Donald Trump got it.\n\nPresident Trump will fuel America\u2019s future and become the first president to achieve American energy independence! President Obama chose not to get it and has tried to destroy this renaissance and all of its benefits. Instead, he turned on Iranian oil, gave them the bomb, billions of dollars, and vilified Israel. Why would he do that?\n\nObama imposed punitive regulations to stop this renaissance.\n\nIn his Administration\u2019s very own words, they want to \u201ccrucify\u201d America\u2019s oil and natural gas producers.\u00a0 Hillary Clinton promises more of the same!\n\nAmerica has two distinct choices.\n\nOur nation should embrace energy independence, not eliminate it.\n\nHillary Clinton would eliminate fossil fuel development in America, kill jobs, drive up gasoline prices and increase oil imports from our enemies. President Trump will release America\u2019s pent-up energy potential, get rid of foreign oil, trash punitive regulations, create millions of jobs, and develop our most strategic geopolitical weapon\u2026 crude oil.\n\nDespite Obama\u2019s attacks, foreign oil imports have plummeted by 65%. America now has more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia or Russia. We can double U.S. oil production again and put America in a global league of its own.\n\nDonald Trump will restore America\u2019s rightful place as the energy leader of the world!\n\nEvery time we can\u2019t drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded! Orlandobrought this home once again. It\u2019s been 15 years since 9/11. We can\u2019t ignore this any longer. Climate change isn\u2019t our biggest problem \u2013 it\u2019s Islamic terrorism! Every onerous regulation puts American lives at risk. Developing America\u2019s own oil supply is a matter of national security. Critics may say I\u2019m just a well-to-do supporter of Donald Trump. They don\u2019t know about the 13th child of sharecroppers who was inspired by Vo-Ag teacher Jim Hunter.\n\nI couldn\u2019t start school before the first snow or Christmas \u2013 whichever came first \u2013 because I was pulling cotton to feed our family. My first memories are picking cotton barefoot. I\u2019m standing here tonight because the American dream was alive and well when I struck out on my own at 20 years old with nothing but a truck, a co-signed note and a phone!\n\nThank God we have a clear choice today.\n\nDonald Trump and Mike Pence will restore the American Dream for the next would-be visionary from small-town America and make America Great Again! God Bless America!\n\n", "My fellow Americans, you have a choice. You deserve better. America deserves better. The well-connected in Washington are lining up behind Hillary Clinton, because she is one of them. They want more of the same.\n\nDonald Trump is standing with the American people.\n\nWe want a leader who is not afraid to take on the mess in Washington.\n\nWe believe that there is a better way forward.\n\nAs Republicans, we believe in an America where everyone can get the education and training that they need to succeed in college, career, and life; one whereWashington doesn\u2019t deepen dependency, but rather helps create genuine opportunity.\n\nWhy? Because America deserves better.\n\nWe believe in a country where people can achieve, maintain, and enjoy their piece of the American Dream \u2013 without the government standing in the way.\n\nWhy? Because America deserves better.\n\nWe believe in a country where we take the threat of terrorism seriously. We name it for what it is: Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nAnd we do everything in our power to eliminate it \u2013 to ensure our safety.\n\nWhy? Because America deserves better.\n\nWe believe in a country where it is a solemn responsibility to deliver to our troops the support and tools they need to achieve victory and then provide them with the health care and respect they\u2019ve earned when they return home.\n\nWhy? Because America deserves better.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it, we believe in a country where those who honorably serve in law enforcement \u2013 the people who put their lives on the line for us \u2013 are not just respected \u2013 they are revered.\n\nWhy? Because America deserves better.\n\nWe believe in a country where power is taken back from Washington and returned home to state and local governments \u2013 where it is more effective, more efficient and more accountable to the people.\n\nWhy? Because America deserves better.\n\nWe believe in a country where freedom and personal success do not come from the clumsy hand of government, but rather the dignity that comes from hard work.\n\nWhy? Because America deserves better.\n\nThe simple truth is: liberal Washington insiders created these problems. AndHillary Clinton is the ultimate liberal Washington insider. If she were any more on the \u201cinside,\u201d she\u2019d be in prison.\n\nAmerica deserves better than Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat is why we need to support Donald Trump and Mike Pence for President and Vice President.\n\nLast August, I said that any of the Republicans running would be better thanHillary Clinton. I meant it then, and I mean it now. So let me be clear: a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump in November is a vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nMake no mistake: we can\u2019t wait four more years and \u201cget \u2019em next time.\u201d The consequences are too great. After hearing the FBI Director\u2019s recent comments, I wouldn\u2019t even give Hillary Clinton the password to my iPhone \u2013 let alone access to classified information. This isn\u2019t just another Clinton scandal, Hillary\u2019s scandal put our national security at risk and that makes her unfit to be President.\n\nIt\u2019s time to tell Hillary: enough is enough. No more double standards for the Clintons.\n\nWhy? Because America deserves better.\n\nThankfully, Republicans are offering a better way forward.\n\nIt\u2019s working right here in Ohio and in Florida, New Mexico, North Carolina andSouth Carolina. And even in Massachusetts and Maryland.\n\nRepublican leadership works. I see it first hand as it\u2019s working in Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2010, we were tired of high unemployment, budget deficits, stifling taxes, and rising college tuition.\n\nMost of all, we were tired of the big government union bosses running our state and local governments. We had enough. So we did something about it. We took back power from the big government special interests and returned it firmly into the hands of the hard-working taxpayers. In turn, the big government special interests \u2013 and their cronies in Washington \u2013 helped organize more than 100,000 protesters who occupied our state Capitol. They tried to intimidate us with threats and mobs, but we didn\u2019t back down. And we won.\n\nThen, they spent tens of millions of dollars to try and defeat us in a recall election, but we didn\u2019t back down. And we won.\n\nThree times they came at us. Three times we won.\n\nWe won because our common sense reforms worked. Today, more people are employed in Wisconsin than ever before, our budget is balanced and responsible, taxes are down for working families and seniors; and college tuition is frozen for four years in a row.\n\nIf conservative reforms can work in a blue state like mine, they can work anywhere in the country. You see, it wasn\u2019t too late for Wisconsin and it\u2019s not too late for America.\n\nIf you\u2019ve had enough of Washington\u2019s brokenness, wastefulness, empty promises and arrogance, join us. Help us elect Republicans to office \u2013 from the courthouse to the statehouse to the White House.\n\nYou have a choice. You decide. You deserve better. Because America deserves better.\n\n", "Thank you. Heidi and I are honored to join you here in Cleveland, where Lebron James just led an incredible comeback victory. I\u2019m convinced America is going to come back too.\n\nI congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night.\n\nConventions are times of excitement. But given the events of the last few weeks, I hope you\u2019ll allow me a moment to talk to you about what\u2019s really at stake.\n\nJust two weeks ago, a nine-year-old girl named Caroline was having a carefreeTexas summer \u2013 swimming in the pool, playing with friends, doing all the things a happy child might do.\n\nLike most children, she took for granted the love she received from her mom, Heidi, and her dad, a police sergeant named Michael Smith. That is, until he became one of the five police officers gunned down in Dallas.\n\nThe day her father was murdered, Caroline gave him a hug and kiss as he left for work. But as they parted, her dad asked her something he hadn\u2019t asked before:\n\n\u201cWhat if this is the last time you ever kiss or hug me?'\u201d\n\nLater, as she thought of her fallen father, and that last heartbreaking hug, Caroline broke down in tears. How could anything ever be OK again?\n\nMichael Smith was a former Army ranger who spent three decades with theDallas Police Department. I have no idea who he voted for in the last election, or what he thought about this one. But his life was a testament to devotion. He protected the very protestors who mocked him because he loved his country and his fellow man. His work gave new meaning to that line from literature, \u201cTo die of love is to live by it.\u201d\n\nAs I thought about what I wanted to say tonight, Michael Smith\u2019s story weighed on my heart. Maybe that\u2019s because his daughter, Caroline, is about the same age as my eldest daughter and happens to share the same name. Maybe it\u2019s because I saw a video of that dear, sweet child choking back sobs as she remembered her daddy\u2019s last question to her. Maybe it\u2019s because we live in a world where so many others have had their lives destroyed by evil, in places like Orlando and Paris andNice and Baton Rouge. Maybe it is because of the simple question itself:\n\nWhat if this, right now, is our last time? Our last moment to do something for our families and our country?\n\nDid we live up to our values? Did we do all we could?\n\nThat\u2019s really what elections should be about. That\u2019s why you and millions like you devoted so much time and sacrifice to this campaign.\n\nWe\u2019re fighting, not for one particular candidate or one campaign, but because\n\neach of us wants to be able to tell our kids and grandkids, our own Carolines, that we did our best for their future, and for our country.\n\nAmerica is more than just a land mass between two oceans. America is an idea, a simple yet powerful idea: freedom matters.\n\nFor much of human history, government power has been the unavoidable constant in life \u2013 government decrees, and the people obey.\n\nNot here. We have no king or queen. No dictator. We the People constrain government.\n\nOur nation is exceptional because it was built on the five most powerful words in the English language: I want to be free.\n\nNever has that message been more needed than today.\n\nWe stand here tonight a nation divided. Partisan rancor, anger, even hatred are tearing America apart.\n\nAnd citizens are furious\u2014rightly furious\u2014at a political establishment that cynically breaks its promises and ignores the will of the people.\n\nWe have to do better. We owe our fallen heroes more than that.\n\nOf course, Obama and Clinton will tell you that they also care about our children\u2019s future. And I want to believe them. But there is a profound difference in our two parties\u2019 visions for the future.\n\nTheirs is the party that thinks ISIS is a \u201cJV team,\u201d that responds to the death of Americans at Benghazi by asking, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d That thinks\n\nit\u2019s possible to make a deal with Iran, which celebrates as holidays \u201cDeath toAmerica Day\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel Day.\u201d\n\nMy friends, this is madness.\n\nPresident Obama is a man who does everything backwards \u2013 he wants to closeGuantanamo Bay and open up our borders, he exports jobs and imports terrorists.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nThere is a better vision for our future: A return to freedom.\n\nOn education, your freedom to choose your child\u2019s education, even if you aren\u2019t as rich as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.\n\nOn healthcare, your freedom to choose your own doctor, without Obamacare.\n\nOn taxes, your freedom to provide for your family without the IRS beating down your door.\n\nThe Internet? Keep it free from taxes, free from regulation. And don\u2019t give it away to Russia and China.\n\nFreedom means free speech, not politically correct safe spaces.\n\nFreedom means religious freedom, whether you are Christian or Jew, Muslim or atheist. Gay or straight, the Bill of Rights protects the rights of all of us to live according to our conscience.\n\nFreedom means the right to keep and bear arms, and protect your family.\n\nFreedom means Supreme Court Justices who don\u2019t dictate policy, but instead follow the Constitution.\n\nAnd freedom means recognizing that our Constitution allows states to choose policies that reflect local values. Colorado may decide something different thanTexas. New York different than Iowa. Diversity. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. If not, what\u2019s the point of having states to begin with?\n\nHillary Clinton believes government should make virtually every choice in your life. Education, healthcare, marriage, speech \u2013 all dictated out of Washington.\n\nBut something powerful is happening. We\u2019ve seen it in both parties. We\u2019ve seen it in the United Kingdom\u2019s unprecedented Brexit vote to leave the European Union.\n\nVoters are overwhelmingly rejecting big government. That\u2019s a profound victory.\n\nPeople are fed up with politicians who don\u2019t listen to them, fed up with a corrupt system that benefits the elites, instead of working men and women.\n\nWe deserve an immigration system that puts America first. And yes, builds a wall to keep us safe.\n\nThat stops admitting ISIS terrorists as refugees.\n\nWe deserve trade policies that put the interests of American farmers and manufacturing jobs over the global interests funding the lobbyists.\n\nAnd if we choose freedom, our future will be brighter.\n\nFreedom will bring back jobs, raise wages.\n\nFreedom will lift people out of dependency, to the dignity of work.\n\nWe can do this. 47 years ago today, America put a man on the moon. That\u2019s the power of freedom.\n\nOur party was founded to defeat slavery. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nWe passed the Civil Rights Act, and fought to eliminate Jim Crow laws.\n\nThose were fights for freedom, and so is this.\n\nSergeant Michael Smith stood up to protect our freedom.\n\nSo do our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines fighting radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nSo did the family of Alton Sterling, who bravely called to end the violence.\n\nSo did the families of those murdered at the Charleston Emanuel AME church, who forgave that hateful, bigoted murderer.\n\nAnd so can we.\n\nWe deserve leaders who stand for principle. Unite us all behind shared values. Cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect, from everybody.\n\nAnd to those listening, please, don\u2019t stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.\n\nIt\u2019s love of freedom that has allowed millions to achieve their dreams. Like my Mom, the first in her family to go to college, and my Dad, who fled prison and torture in Cuba, coming to Texas with just $100 sewn into his underwear.\n\nAnd it is love that I hope will bring comfort to a grieving 9-year-old girl in Dallas \u2013 and, God willing, propel her to move forward, and dream, and soar . . . and make her daddy proud.\n\nWe must make the most of our moment \u2013 to fight for freedom, to protect our God-given rights, even of those with whom we don\u2019t agree, so that when we are old and gray . . . and our work is done . . . and we give those we love one final kiss goodbye . . . we will be able to say, \u201cFreedom matters, and I was part of something beautiful.\u201d\n\nThank you. And may God bless the United States of America.\n\n", "Thank you for that very generous welcome.\u00a0And thank you, Callista.\u00a0 You know, she makes documentary films, and writes a best-selling children\u2019s series on American history.\u00a0In addition, she sings in the Basilica Choir, and plays the French horn in the Fairfax Band.\u00a0 I am amazed at her achievements.\n\nTonight I want to speak about a subject that has dominated my thinking for decades: How do we keep America safe?\n\nKeeping America safe is the first responsibility of the American president. There have been many fascinating things to watch about the extraordinary,historic rise of Donald Trump.\n\nBut the most significant has been Donald Trump\u2019s courage to tell some important truths about our national security.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u2014\u00a0\u00a0 We are at War.\n\n\u2014\u00a0\u00a0 We are at War with Radical Islamists.\n\n\u2014\u00a0\u00a0 They are determined to kill us.\n\n\u2014\u00a0 They are stronger than we admit\n\n\u2014 And are greater in number than we admit.\n\n\u2014\u00a0 And there is NO substitute for victory.\n\nIn contrast to Donald Trump, our national security and foreign policy elites, led by Hillary Clinton, are incapable of speaking with such honesty.\n\nWhile THEY lie about the threat, WE need to tell the truth about the\u00a0 danger.\n\nIf our enemies had their way, not a single woman in this room could define her future.\n\nIf our enemies had their way, not a single Jew or Christian in this room would be alive unless they agreed to submit.\n\nIf our enemies had their way, gays, lesbians and transgender citizens would be put to death as they are today in the Islamic State and Iran.\n\nIf our enemies had their way, every person on earth would be subject to conversion by the sword and to a cruel and violent system of\u00a0 laws.\n\nThere would be no individual liberty. There would be no equality.\n\nThere would be no freedom. If you doubt we are at war\u2026\n\nIf you doubt that this threat is as real as I say\u2026 Let me refresh your memory:\n\nOn Monday, an Afghan refugee in Germany used an axe and knives to slash\u00a0 and wound train passengers while shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar.\u201d\n\nLast week, ISIS claimed responsibility after a Tunisian man drove a cargo truck into crowd in Nice, France. He murdered 84 people, including at least 10 children and three Americans, and injured over 300 others.\n\nTwo weeks ago, more than 300 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded in bombing attacks in Baghdad.\n\nTwo days before that, radical Islamists in Bangladesh killed 20 hostages, including 3 American college students.\n\nA few days before that, at the Istanbul airport in Turkey, ISIS attackers armed with guns and bombs killed 44 people and injured a few hundred more.\n\nLast month, a radical Islamist in Paris stalked a French police officer to his home, where he murdered the officer and tortured his wife to death in front of their three-year-old son, while streaming it all on social media.\n\nHe was pondering whether to kill the three-year-old when he was killed by police.\n\nTwo days before that, an attacker pledging allegiance to ISIS killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub and wounded dozens more.\n\nAll this in JUST the past 37 days.\n\nWe risk growing numb to these accumulating atrocities.\n\nOne recent analysis estimated that since January of 2015, some 30,000 people have been killed at the hands of terrorists.\nDonald Trump is right.\n\nWe are at war with radical Islamists, we are losing the war, and we must change course to win the war.\n\nLet me be very clear, because I know the news media will do their best to distort this.\n\nWe have nothing to fear from the vast majority of Muslims in the United States, or around the world.\n\nThe vast majority are peaceful. They are often the victims of the violence themselves.\n\nThey are people we would be happy to have as our friends and neighbors.\n\nThe challenge is, when even a small percentage of a billion, six hundred million people support violence against those who disagree with them, that is still a giant recruiting base.\n\nFor example, Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistansupport ISIS.\n\nUnfortunately, that 9 percent is 16 million people. And that\u2019s just one country.\n\nSo the truth is,\u00a0although\u00a0we are losing the war with radical Islamists, we have been very lucky.\n\nThe danger we face is much worse than the horrors that happened in Germanyon New Year\u2019s Eve, when 2,000 women were assaulted.\n\nIt\u2019s worse than what\u2019s happening in France, where there are stabbings of Jews in the streets and the intelligence chief warned recently that Europe is QUOTE \u201con the brink of civil war.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worse than what\u2019s happening in Israel, where average citizens fear for their lives whenever they leave their homes.\n\nThe danger is even worse than September 11th, when 19 hijackers murdered almost 3,000 Americans.\n\nNo. The worst case scenario is losing an American city to terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction.\n\nInstead of losing 3,000 people in one morning, we could lose more than 300,000.\n\nInstead of losing 2 great buildings, we could lose block after block after\u00a0 block to a nuclear event.\n\nThat\u2019s not just my view. Back in January of 2001, the Hart Rudman Commission warned that terrorists QUOTE, \u201cwill acquire weapons of mass destruction\u2026and some will use them.\n\nAmericans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers.\u201d 15 years later, the dangers are even greater.\n\nIn a world where Pakistan has nuclear weapons\u2026 where North Korea has nuclear weapons\u2026\n\nand where IRAN\u2013the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism\u2013is close to having nuclear weapons\u2026this, a catastrophic attack on innocent Americans, is a very real threat.\n\nWhich brings us to the heart of the\u00a0matter.\n\nWe are sleepwalking through history as though this is all about politics. It is not.\nIt is about our safety and our survival as a country.\n\nAnd this is why every American should be terrified at the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency.\n\nIf Hillary is elected, she will keep in place the people and the systems that lie to us every single day about this threat.\n\nWe know she will do this because as Secretary of State, she has been right at the center of this dishonesty.\n\nWe know this administration and its allies lied to us about the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nWe know it because they openly bragged about it to the New York Times.\n\nWe know that Hillary Clinton lied to us knowingly about the terror attack on\u00a0 our\n\nBenghazi consulate on September 11, 2012.\n\nWe know that Hillary Clinton and President Obama lie to the American people when they say they can safely screen the Syrian refugees.\u00a0 They\u00a0cannot.\u00a0 And yet Hillary wants to increase the number by 500 percent.\n\nSo when you hear about Hillary\u2019s dishonesty, or the emails, or taking millions from the Saudis and other Middle Eastern dictatorships\u2013remember: this is NOT about politics.\n\nThe cost of Hillary\u2019s dishonesty could be the loss of America as we know it. The first step forward to safety is electing a leader who will be truthful with\u00a0 the American people about the realities we face.\u00a0Only then will we understand, support, and demand the strategies required to confront this threat.\n\nAnd because safety and security are the preconditions for our freedom and prosperity, it is also the first step toward rebuilding the America we\u00a0 love.\nDonald Trump understands this.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why he WILL rebuild our military\u2013because he knows that a strong military is the best way to ensure peace.\n\nDonald Trump WILL secure our borders\u2013because there is no such thing as a nation without a border.\n\nDonald Trump WILL enforce our immigration laws. He will end the policy of deliberate non-enforcement and will end the abuse of our visa programs\u2013to protect American workers, and their wages.\n\nDonald Trump WILL take care of our veterans by holding bureaucrats at\u00a0 the Veterans Administration accountable.\n\nHe WILL fire those responsible for the waiting lists, and WILL give veterans more choices about their care.\n\nWith Donald Trump\u2019s leadership, no bureaucrat will get between a veterans and their doctor.\n\nDonald Trump WILL get America building again.\n\nHe will blow apart the ridiculous regulations and requirements that drive up infrastructure costs and drag out the timeline to get anything\u00a0 built.\n\nThe Trump Infrastructure program WILL make us once again the most competitive economy in the world.\n\nDonald Trump WILL rebuild our education system, and give EVERY PARENT\u00a0\u00a0 of EVERY income and EVERY ethnic background a choice about where their children go to school.\n\nAnd Donald Trump will help us rebuild our communities one life and one family at a time. Here again, the first step is safety\u2013 the \u00a0basis for strong families, and good jobs, and vibrant neighborhoods.\n\nThat means restoring law and order.\n\nDonald Trump will show ZERO tolerance for people calling for the death of police officers.\n\nThink about this. If anyone publicly threatens the life of the President of the United States, the Secret Service is on them in an\u00a0instant.\n\nOur law enforcement officers deserve the same respect.\n\nAnd OF COURSE, if individual officers are found to have violated someone\u2019s rights, they must be held accountable under the law.\n\nAmerica is BASED on the rule of law.\n\nWe are one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for ALL.\n\nThat is what has allowed us to absorb more people from more backgrounds than any nation in history.\n\nNobody is above the law.\n\nAnd nobody is too small to deserve its protection.\n\nDonald Trump won our party\u2019s nomination because he is willing to tell the truth about the things that matter most.\n\nHe has a GREAT running mate in Mike Pence.\n\nThey will put our safety first, and they will defend America first. We can be proud to stand with them.\n\nSo tonight, the challenge for everyone in this hall, and everyone\u2013Republican, Democrat, or Independent\u2013who is watching at home and knows we cannot continue on our current course\u2026\n\n\u2026Is to rise above our factions, and rise above the politics we\u2019ve inherited; to ignore the lies of the news media and the old order;\u00a0to reject the suicidal DISHONESTY of Hillary Clinton and her establishment allies; \u00a0and to be proud to stand with Donald Trump and Mike Pence for \u00a0what we know is true:\n\nWe CAN make America safe again; We CAN make America work again; We CAN make America first again;\n\nAnd together, we CAN make America great again \u2014 for ALL Americans. Thank you and God Bless the United States of America.\n\nClinton/Kaine: 228\n\nTrump/Pence: 290\n\nDemocrats: 48*(+2)\n\nRepublicans: 52(-2)\n\nDemocrats: 193(+6)\n\nRepublicans: 238(-6)\n\n", "Mealer sustained his injury in a car crash involving several members of his family just five minutes away from their home. His brother Elliot, an offensive lineman headed to the University of Michigan to play football, was able to free Brock from the wreckage, but the two brothers lost their father, David, and Elliot\u2019s girlfriend,Hollis Richer, in the crash.\u00a0Today, Brock has conquered the odds and is able to walk again.\n\nChristmas Eve 2007, my parents, my younger brother, Elliott, his girlfriend, Hollis Richer, and I were driving to church. Out of nowhere, a car ran a stop sign, crashing into us. My father, my hero, David Paul Mealer, and Hollis died that night.\n\nI endured eight and a half hours of surgery.\n\nWhen I awoke, the surgeon came into my hospital room with more devastating news.\n\nMy spinal cord damage was about the worst she had ever seen. She said that I would likely never walk again\u2014that even a one percent chance was overly optimistic.\n\nBut that 1% was all I needed. Through it all, I had faith in Jesus Christ, believed in myself and strived to make that one percent a reality.\n\nTruthfully, God made that 1% a reality; His will, not mine. He blessed me with football coaches Rich and Mike, who gave me a fighting chance. His blessings enabled me to graduate from The Ohio State University and go on to be cheered by University of Michigan fans, as I led the Wolverines onto the field. He blessed me with my beautiful wife, Haley; we walked down the aisle together. He gave me countless other blessings. This very moment, for me, is a testament to God working all things for the good.\n\nAnd guess who else was told he had a 1% chance? A company that analyzes polling data for CNN predicted last year that Donald Trump had a 1% chance of winning the Republican nomination for president. Mr. Trump, welcome to the club!\n\nI defied the odds. But I couldn\u2019t do it on my own.\n\nDonald Trump can\u2019t do it alone either. He needs our help and support. Just asMichigan was willing to adopt a Buckeye, for a cause greater than ourselves, we can unite behind Donald Trump to Make America One Again.\n\nNow I want to turn it over to a fellow Ohio State graduate who really knows how to unite a team\u2014Coach Bobby Knight.\n\n", "Good evening to all and to those watching at home, on iPhones, and Twitter. I have a question. Do you want to help make America one again?\n\nWe\u2019ve had enough of bloated budgets, un-kept promises, pointless redlines.\n\nEnough division and heated rhetoric whose only purpose is to drive a wedge between us and our neighbor. Enough seeing our 401ks get smaller, our bills get bigger, our taxes go up and our paychecks shrink. We\u2019ve had enough!\n\nYou\u2019re ready for a change \u2013 for someone to take the reins, bring us together.\n\nA man who can get the job done. Or as Larry the Cable guy would say, \u2018Git \u2018er done! Someone who comes in ahead of schedule and under budget.\n\nWho\u2019s read the specs, seen the bottom line, negotiated the cost, built something to last. A leader who knows the country is not full of assets to be managed, forgotten, deleted. Our nation\u2019s citizens want a leader who knows the sure route to prosperity, who inspires, who knows leading is a hard-fought verb and not a subject line in an email.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you to join me in electing Donald Trump president.\n\nDonald Trump has the skills required to lead such a diverse nation, and can help people achieve greatness. He believes in the American dream because he has lived the American dream. Why?\n\nGreatness isn\u2019t new. President Lincoln stood in this very city 155 years ago with a call to bind together or perish apart: \u201cIf all do not join now to save the good ship of the Union this voyage, nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another.\u201d\n\nAnd again we find our nation in desperate need of true leadership. We are in desperate need of unity.\n\nThe last eight years have been a challenge, to our national and household budgets, our Constitution, to the men and women who give their lives and sacred honor to protect both.\n\nDonald Trump is a leader who has seen challenges, learned lessons, solved problems, delivered results.\n\nSome of our greatest leaders have been people who worked in the real world, know firsthand how cumbersome rules and unnecessary regulations get in the way of greatness.\n\nI want a president who knows leadership is not as it appears, but as it performs. Who has seen something through from beginning to completion. Who looks at the mundane, sees magnificence. After all, that\u2019s the magic of this country \u2013 everyday people, with big ideas and the drive to complete them, can change the world.\n\nLeadership is not about lines on a resume.\n\nGender, race, zip code, pedigree, lineage and hurt feelings aren\u2019t qualifiers. Leadership is a record of performance, accomplishment, team building.\n\nThat\u2019s leadership you can trust.\n\nAmericans are bound together by the shared desire for freedom, faith, family, hope, and opportunity. We want a president who believes that you, notWashington, know what\u2019s best. Believes you have the right to pursue your version of the American dream.\n\nAmerica is on the edge of great, mighty things. We need a President Donald Trump who is about freedom. Who will choose to unite, not divide.\n\nTogether we\u2019ll get the country building, working, see jobs come back, communities grow, leaders lead.\n\nTogether we\u2019ll be great again.\n\nTogether we\u2019ll be one again.\n\n", "Fallin has served as the chairman of the National Governors Association, where she led a nationwide initiative to help better align education with the needs of a modern-day workforce.\n\nThank you.\n\nI grew up in Tecumseh, a small town in Oklahoma. It was one of those all-American towns where everyone watches high school football on Friday nights, and neighbors take care of neighbors. In Tecumseh, we understood poverty. But it wasn\u2019t a destiny that was inevitable. We were optimistic about the future, and knew we could succeed with hard work, a good education and faith in God.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many opportunities for young women, but we did have a great role model: the mayor, my mom. She taught me if I worked hard, I could be anything. I took that lesson to heart, and eventually became the first female governor ofOklahoma.\n\nEven at a time when the shadow of institutional discrimination fell over much of our country, there was no shortage of African-American heroes. Black Oklahomans like Clara Luper were leading sit-ins and successfully integrating schools across the state, winning the fight for respect and opportunity. So, when I look back on my childhood, my America, I don\u2019t see a perfect place. But we were united by a simple belief: that no matter who you were or where you came from, better days were just ahead for America.\n\nToday, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re losing that sense of unity and optimism, not just in towns like Tecumseh, but across this land. Our country is divided, our people are afraid, and our spirits are nearly broken. But we can\u2019t allow hopelessness to become the new normal. And we won\u2019t.\n\nThe American people are longing for the American dream where they can get a fair shake at life and the opportunity to succeed. We must make America One Again and restore confidence in the strength of our nation.\n\nIt is no secret Donald Trump is a bold, tenacious, courageous and outspoken leader. He knows how to create jobs and successful businesses. He has bold ideas and speaks truth to power. He is a man who will get this country on the right track, who believes in peace through strength and will protect America against radical Islamic terrorists who seek our destruction. Our nation has united time and time again on our core values of freedom, individual liberty and justice for all \u2013 the principles on which our country was founded, and the principles that Donald Trump unapologetically stands for.\n\nWe are one in our belief that America must address the national debt \u2013 not by increasing taxes \u2013 but by increasing opportunity. We are one in our belief that we must protect our borders, and promote fair trade that puts American workers first. We are one in our belief that we must stand with allies like Israel, a beacon of freedom and democracy in the Middle East. We are one in our belief that we must respect and honor our military, veterans, and law enforcement, whose sacrifice keeps us safe and free. And we are one in our belief in that every life is precious, regardless of race or class, including the lives of unborn children.\n\nAs a party, we don\u2019t agree 100 percent on everything. That\u2019s OK. We don\u2019t have to. As Ronald Reagan said, \u201cthe person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and ally.\u201d We invite every American who believes in these principles, who longs for an end to division and wants to make America one again, to join us in electing Donald Trump president of the United States.\n\nMay God bless you all, and may God bless America!\n\n", "My name is Lisa Shin. I am deeply humbled and honored to speak to you as a national delegate from the great state of New Mexico!\n\nI am a Christian, a wife, and a mother. I have been in private practice as an optometrist for the past 19 years. I am Korean-American. And I am very proud to be a supporter of the next President of the United States, Donald J. Trump!\n\nOver 40 years ago, my parents left South Korea to come to America. They knew that America was an exceptional and generous country where immigrants could become American citizens, participate in American democracy, and live the American dream. They knew America was the land of opportunity and freedom, where immigrants could succeed and prosper. So they swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. My parents endured countless hardships and made tremendous sacrifices to pursue the Dream. And they never imagined that one day, their daughter would be speaking to you today. This is the beauty of the American Dream: to do and to be, the unimaginable.\n\nHillary Clinton is a direct threat to the American Dream.\n\nHer proposals would be utterly devastating to our economy. Her dangerous ideology undermines our democracy and freedom. She represents everything that is wrong with the system: the deceit, corruption, cronyism, and a total lack of accountability. With extreme carelessness, she has compromised our national security and our safety. With contempt, she has flouted the rule of law that we rely on for justice, order, and peace. She has overwhelmingly lost the trust of the American people. She is not qualified to be our next president. She is unfit to be the commander in chief of the brave men and women who sacrifice so much to fight for our country.\n\nThere is only one presidential candidate who will preserve the American dream that our parents and our grandparents envisioned for us. There is only one candidate who will ensure a more prosperous, safe, and secure future for our children and our grandchildren. There is only one candidate who will defend the core principles that this great country was founded upon. There is only one candidate who will protect, stand with and fight for we, the American people. There is only clear choice for America: that choice is Donald J. Trump.\n\nThank you.\n\n", "Thank you.\n\nTo the people of Cleveland, we say thank you for your hospitality. I stand before this convention tonight as the Chairman of a party that is carrying the torch of liberty.\n\nWe are the party of the open door.\n\nTo some people and some presidents America is just another country. To Republicans, America is the greatest nation on earth.\n\nWe don\u2019t apologize for America. We celebrate America.\n\nAt every level, Republicans stand for aspiration and achievement. We stand for peace and prosperity. We stand for freedom and fairness.\n\nThese values have inspired people the world-over, ever since we won our freedom over two centuries ago. These values fueled the sacrifices for freedom at Gettysburg and Normandy and Fallujah. These values spurred the fight for equality in Birmingham and Selma.\n\nIt is clear the Republican Party is the only party willing to fight for these values and lead America to greatness in the 21st century.\n\nSee, the dirty little secret Democrats don\u2019t want you to know is that they are the party of the same old thing. Next week they are going to trot out the same old Democrats with the same old message running the same old candidate.\n\nWe are the party of new ideas in a world changing faster than ever.\n\nDemocrats depend on super delegates and bureaucrats to sneak their agenda through the backdoor.\n\nWe are the party of the grassroots. We honor what the voters say.\n\nDemocrats want to put labor union bosses in charge of our schools, limit our choices, and feed our kids a steady diet of left-wing propaganda.\n\nWe know every child matters and the classroom is not an assembly line. It\u2019s time to give power back to parents, embrace school choice, and equip our children with the skills they need for college, career and life.\n\nDemocrats want healthcare choices in the hands of politicians. We want healthcare choices in the hands of patients. Democrats want Washington to impose a one-size-fits-all policy on everybody.\n\nWe say an independent people deserves individual solutions.\n\nWhat separates Republicans from Democrats is our belief in better. We believe in better schools. A better healthcare system. A better economy which rewards hard work no matter where or when you punch the clock.\n\nAnd most of all, we believe in a better chance at the American dream for everyone. The Republican Party will not stop until it becomes a reality. And that\u2019s why we need to stop Hillary Clinton.\n\nA Clinton presidency only means more debt, more Obamacare, and more hard-working families never seeing a raise.\n\nIf given the chance, Hillary Clinton will stack the Supreme Court with activist left-wing judges who will treat the Constitution like a doormat.\n\nYou can kiss your gun rights goodbye if she ever finds her way into the White House. In foreign policy, a Clinton presidency means forgetting our friends and enabling our enemies.\n\nJust look at her disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which lined the pockets of the world\u2019s number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money, while abandoning our greatest ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel.\n\nIt was on her watch ISIS began to spread its wings of evil over the Middle East. And she has spent the last 16 months looking into the eyes of the American people and lying about how she recklessly jeopardized national security with her secret email server.\n\nShe lied. And she lied over and over and over.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, Hillary Clinton has perfected the art of politics for personal gain. She reads ethics rules as carefully as Americans read their junk mail. Just look at her track record.\n\nShe used her post as Secretary of State to grease the wheels for Democrat lobbyists, special interests, and political insiders connected to the corrupt Clinton Machine.\n\nHer family foundation took millions of dollars in donations from countries\n\nnotorious for human rights abuses and funneling money to radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nFor Hillary Clinton, the Oval Office is just another cash cow. Well, I have one word for all this hypocrisy and corruption.\n\nEnough.\n\nAmericans have had enough of a government that plays favorites with the well-connected. They\u2019ve had enough of the Clintons\u2019 excuses, cronyism and cover ups. They\u2019ve had enough of the corrupt dealings. Americans have had enough.\n\nThis election is our chance to stop it and Donald Trump is the right man to lead that charge. He\u2019s brought millions of new voters into our party because he\u2019s listening to Americans who are anxious about a country which has lost its way.\n\nDonald Trump wants to bring jobs back from overseas and hold companies who want to send them abroad accountable. He\u2019s finally going to stop illegal immigration and make sure our government puts American citizens first.\n\nWorking families are the lifeblood of our country, and we can\u2019t thrive as a nation unless they are thriving. A lot of them haven\u2019t seen a bigger paycheck in a long time.\n\nDonald Trump wants to make sure you can pay the mortgage, put gas in the car, and buy new clothes for the first day of school.\n\nDonald Trump is committed to hitting terrorists hard and making the safety of every man, woman, and child in America his number one priority.\n\nNo more negotiating with terrorists. If they want to take us down, we will take them down.\n\nHe will protect the Second Amendment, and every other right guaranteed in the Constitution, by appointing conservative justices to the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd he\u2019s going to protect the lives of the unborn. So I have a message to America: hold on.\n\nHelp is coming.\n\nWith Donald Trump and Mike Pence, America is ready for a comeback after almost a decade of Clinton-Obama failures.\n\nI want to close by telling you a little-known story of American greatness.\n\nWilliam Nudesen was a Danish immigrant who started out working in a shipyard and living in a boardinghouse. He knew America promised limitless opportunity, and was determined to make the most of it.\u00a0 He developed his talents for industrial engineering and worked his way up at General Motors. By 1937, he had become the President of the company.\n\nIn 1940, the government asked him to get America\u2019s factories on a wartime footing.\n\nInstead of cars and trucks, America\u2019s great manufacturers were now proudly making tanks and planes.\u00a0 For this enormous responsibility, Nudesen was paid $1per year.\n\nHe didn\u2019t do the job for the money. He was motivated by a duty to keep America free from tyranny. He set aside the job of leading one of the largest companies in America so he could help save the world.\n\nAt the end of the war, a war department official told him, \u201cYou have never done anything for yourself, only for your country. You have never spared yourself.\u201d\n\nLike William Nudesen, we cannot spare ourselves either. Economic freedom. Belief in the American Dream. A strong national defense. Putting country first.\n\nThose values are under assault from Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Democrat party. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is not just a tagline for a bumper sticker.\n\nIt is our American legacy, and it is our responsibility to save it and strengthen it for our children and grandchildren.\n\nGod put us here not by accident. This is our moment to set a new course for an America as strong and confident as we\u2019ve ever been.\n\nLet\u2019s stand united as Republicans. Let\u2019s stop Hillary Clinton. Let\u2019s get to work, expand our Republican majorities, and elect Donald Trump president.\n\nThank you and God bless America.\n\n", "Thank you. I am honored and humbled to be here tonight.\n\nIn 1984, my father stood at this convention and offered the opening prayer before our party\u2019s candidate, Ronald Reagan, went on to accept the nomination and win in a landslide.\n\nA little over 30 years later, I stand here with the sincerest prayer that history is about to repeat itself with the election of Donald J Trump. Most of our nation\u2019s founders had strong faith, as I do, in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nMy family has lived in Virginia since the 1600s and in the Lynchburg, Virginia area since 1834.\n\nMy wife, Becki, is a descendant of George Washington\u2019s family.\u00a0 Every day, I drive past Poplar Forest, the summer home of Thomas Jefferson who wrote in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nWe are all endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nOur founding fathers envisioned a government that existed only to protect these God given rights and a nation governed by citizen legislators.\n\nThe most effective politicians were never career politicians, but surveyors, architects, ministers, farmers, businessmen and even actors who were successful in the private sector before serving in government.\n\nDonald Trump follows in this rich tradition. He has created jobs for thousands and is one of the greatest visionaries of our time.\n\nI first supported Mr. Trump after I spent 20 years as a young lawyer working with my father to restore Liberty University to financial health.\n\nSince 2007 Liberty has become the largest and most prosperous Christian university in the world and I am convinced that Donald Trump can work the same magic for a nation $19 trillion in debt.\n\nBut my family and I have grown to love and respect the Trumps for other reasons. We have never met such a genuine and loving family.\u00a0 I truly believe Mr. Trump is America\u2019s blue collar billionaire. He is down to earth, he loves America and the American people. He is a true patriot and a champion of the common man.\n\nMr. Trump has added a plank to this party\u2019s platform to repeal IRS rules sponsored by Lyndon Johnson in 1954 barring churches and non-profits from expressing political free speech. Conservative universities and churches have been investigated while authorities have too often turned a blind-eye toward liberal groups, including universities where left-wing ideology is so pervasive that they have in effect become Democratic-voter indoctrination camps. Trust me, this will create a huge revolution for conservative Christians.\n\nWe are at a crossroads where our first priority must be saving our nation. We must unite behind Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\n\nA decision not to vote or to vote for a third-party candidate is a de facto vote forHillary Clinton. If Hillary Clinton is allowed to appoint the next few Supreme Court justices, that in itself could be a fatal blow to our republic.\n\nOn the other hand, a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to uphold the 2nd amendment right to bear arms. A vote for Trump is a vote to stop Iran, a nation committed to the destruction of the state of Israel, from becoming a nuclear power. A vote for Trump is a vote to appoint conservative pro-life justices to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the days before my father passed away in 2007, he joked with CNN that he dreamed Chelsea Clinton had asked him in an interview about the three greatest threats facing the nation. He replied, Osama, Obama and yo\u2019 Momma. Osama is now gone, Obama has six months left on his term and the only way to make America great (and one) again is to keep Chelsea\u2019s Momma from ever becoming president of the US by electing Donald Trump and Mike Pence as the next president and vice-president of the United States.\n\n", "Good evening. I\u2019m Peter Thiel.\n\nI build companies and I support people who are building new things, from social networks to rocket ships.\n\nI\u2019m not a politician.\n\nBut neither is Donald Trump.\n\nHe is a builder, and it\u2019s time to rebuild America.\n\nWhere I work in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s hard to see where America has gone wrong.\n\nMy industry has made a lot of progress in computers and in software, and, of course, it\u2019s made a lot of money.\n\nBut Silicon Valley is a small place.\n\nDrive out to Sacramento, or even just across the bridge to Oakland, and you won\u2019t see the same prosperity. That\u2019s just how small it is.\n\nAcross the country, wages are flat.\n\nAmericans get paid less today than ten years ago. But healthcare and college tuition cost more every year. Meanwhile Wall Street bankers inflate bubbles in everything from government bonds to Hillary Clinton\u2019s speaking fees.\n\nOur economy is broken. If you\u2019re watching me right now, you understand this better than any politician in Washington. And you know this isn\u2019t the dream we looked forward to. Back when my parents came to America looking for that dream, they found it\u2014right here in Cleveland.\n\nThey brought me here as a one-year-old, and this is where I became an American.\n\nOpportunity was everywhere.\n\nMy Dad studied engineering at Case Western Reserve University, just down the road from where we are now. Because in 1968, the world\u2019s high tech capital wasn\u2019t just one city: all of America was high tech.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to remember this, but our government was once high tech, too. When I moved to Cleveland, defense research was laying the foundations for the Internet. The Apollo program was just about to put a man on the moon\u2014and it was Neil Armstrong, from right here in Ohio.\n\nThe future felt limitless.\n\nBut today our government is broken. Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks. Our newest fighter jets can\u2019t even fly in the rain. And it would be kind to say the government\u2019s software works poorly, because much of the time it doesn\u2019t even work at all.\n\nThat is a staggering decline for the country that completed the Manhattan Project. We don\u2019t accept such incompetence in Silicon Valley, and we must not accept it from our government.\n\nInstead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East. We don\u2019t need to seeHillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails: her incompetence is in plain sight. She pushed for a war in Libya, and today it\u2019s a training ground for ISIS. On this most important issue, Donald Trump is right. It\u2019s time to end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country.\n\nWhen I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union. And we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom.\n\nThis is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?\n\nOf course, every American has a unique identity.\n\nI am proud to be gay.\n\nI am proud to be a Republican.\n\nBut most of all I am proud to be an American.\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to agree with every plank in our party\u2019s platform. But fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline.\n\nAnd nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump.\n\nWhile it is fitting to talk about who we are, today it\u2019s even more important to remember where we came from. For me that is Cleveland, and the bright future it promised.\n\nWhen Donald Trump asks us to Make America Great Again, he\u2019s not suggesting a return to the past. He\u2019s running to lead us back to that bright future.\n\nTonight I urge all of my fellow Americans to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.\n\n", "Hello Republicans, are you Ready to elect the next President of these United States of America? I\u2019m Pastor Mark Burns from the Great State of South Carolina!\n\nIt is so important Republicans, that we come together to defeat Hillary Clintonand those liberal race-baiting, Democrats who will do whatever it takes to keep us Americans focusing on the colors that divide us and not the colors that unite us. Because only together we will never allow Hillary Clinton to become the next President of the United States of America.\n\nAnd I want to declare to the whole world and to the Republican Party that under a Donald Trump Administration, all lives matter. That means black lives, white lives, Hispanic lives, Asian lives, Christian lives, Muslim lives, shout with me, all lives matter.\n\nEven though I disagree with the tactics and divisive rhetoric of the Black Lives Matter movement, I do understand that hopelessness and lack of opportunity breeds desperation.\n\nThis is true in many of our nation\u2019s ghettos and underprivileged communities. Much of protests in urban centers are born out of this kind of desperation. Good jobs, urban economic revitalization, and an opportunity for job training are long-term solutions that can turn our troubled cities around.\n\nWe as Republicans are declaring to the world that we are more determined than ever to listen to the cries of the disenfranchised, of the low-income and at-risk communities. And I know, without a shadow of doubt, that Donald J. Trump will make sure that all Americans will have\u00a0\u00a0 jobs!\n\nAnd if we together, not as black Americans, white Americans, brown Americans, yellow Americans, or red Americans, but just as Americans, that we as a people will get to the promise land where jobs have returned to this country, college degrees replace mass incarcerations, and no matter what terrorist group that tries to destroy our way of life, we will always rise from the ashes, we will never die, why, because we are the United States of America! And despite the color you was born with, here in America, the only colors that matter is the colors of red, white and blue! USA. USA. USA.\n\nI\u2019m Pastor Mark Burns, and I invite you to help me elect the next President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!\n\n", "Tonight, I am honored to stand before you as the son of a humble Lebanese grocer,\n\nthe grandson of immigrants, and a proud American blessed to live in the freest nation on Earth.\n\nFor over three decades, I have seen Donald up close and personal, as a great pal and business partner, across the spectrum of life\u2019s twists and turns. My purpose here in front of you today is to share a different side of Donald Trump \u2013 a side that is not always made visible by the press but one that becomes as clear as day when you move a little closer, beyond the glaring lights, and television cameras.\n\nThe words that I use to describe Donald are words that people do not hear often: compassionate, kind, loyal, dedicated, trustworthy, courageous, empathetic and fatherly.\n\nChildren are the true litmus test for all of us as parents. Many of you have gotten to know Donald\u2019s children during this Convention, and, as you have seen, they are far from children of entitlement and privilege but rather share a legacy of grace, dedication, intense discipline and a rare touch, like their father, to connect with people.\n\nI could share many stories about Donald\u2019s tremendous business acumen and instincts \u2013 his incredible ability to build consensus among warring factions and bring adversaries together behind a workable solution.\n\nI have nothing negative to say about Hillary because I do not need to. Instead, I will share why Donald is the best and the most capable athlete on the field, in what has become a simple race between entrenched status quo and enlightened disruption. I know that Donald is that athlete because I have watched him through the mountains and the valleys by sticking to simple, practical tenets like:\n\nDon\u2019t confuse efforts with results. Do what you say. Do it now.\n\nAlways give the bad news first. Be clear and direct.\n\nTake care of all those around you and the universe will take care of you. Hire smarter people than yourself.\n\nMost importantly, Donald knows that every morning in the jungle a lion awakes knowing that he must run faster than the slowest gazelle. And every gazelle awakens knowing that she must run faster than the fastest lion. Whether a lion or gazelle, you better wake up and run like crazy. And this he does. No one works harder or runs faster than Donald. Standing still is simply not an option.\n\nRonald Reagan taught us that the best presidents are not always those with the longest resumes, but those who are able to lead, inspire, define the race, recruit a world class team and then set the pace.\n\nI\u2019d like to give you some insight into the Donald Trump you don\u2019t see on TV or read about in his books by sharing two small examples that reveal his heart and compassion. In 1988, Donald invited my son and me to join him and his son at the Tyson-Holmes heavyweight title fight. We arrived in Atlantic City in Donald\u2019s helicopter to a frenzy of paparazzi. We approached the convention center, lights flashing \u2026 hundreds of people yelling \u2026 everyone fighting for Donald\u2019s attention \u2013 a zoo!\n\nAs we entered the service entrance amidst this chaos, a doorman called out, \u201cMr.\n\nTrump.\u201d Donald remembered him and stopped the entire procession. \u201cHey, Louie, how\u2019s it going,\u201d he asked? They traded small talk, and then Louie thanked Donald for all he had done for his employees and to tell him his son, who was ill, thought he was the greatest man in the world.\u00a0 Donald grasped his hand, looked him in the eye, and said, \u201cNo, Louie, you\u2019re the greatest.\u201d\n\nWe got to our seats five minutes before the bell rang to start the fight. The crowd was going nuts. People were tugging at Donald, vying for his attention, but Donald seemed agitated. He asked me for my program.\n\nHe wrote out a note and had it hand-deliver it to Louie, inviting him and his son to visit with him the next day. About a decade later, Donald and I sat in the foyer of Frank Campbell Funeral Home awaiting the wake of his father, Fred Trump, the son of immigrants, a carpenter who made the most of the blessings of freedom.\n\nWe sat alone, musing about life\u2019s challenges and that, at the end of the day, it is not about accumulating things or fame but about being relevant. In that solemn moment, Donald shared something so simple, yet so resonating and powerful. \u201cTom,\u201d he said \u201cI think I have the strength of my dad and the sensitivities of my mom. All I want to do now is to take the Trump name and the legacy they built brick by brick and leave it a little bit better than I found it.\u201d\n\nThe world is at a tipping point. The old order is crumbling like a house built on shifting sands. Americans will no longer accept those who just talk of change. People understand that we need a battle-hardened CEO with the proven ability of \u201cbeing\u201d the change to once again jewel the varied and disparate gems of a disenfranchised society back into a seamless necklace of national pride.\u00a0 He can do this not because the opposition is so bad. But because he is so good.\n\nThat is the kind of man Donald Trump is. And, with your help that is the kind of President he will be.\n\n", "The greatest and most revered coaching legend of the National Football League is one Vince Lombardi, Italian-American, tough as nails.\n\nIn the 50s, he took over a broken Green Bay Packers football team and made it into a world championship team year after year.\n\nAs great as he was, he didn\u2019t always win. There\u2019s a video that\u2019s been out there for years.\u00a0 It tells the story. Lombardi, fists thrust in the pockets of his heavy wool coat, paces the Lambeau Field sideline, like a caged tiger.\n\nThat day, the Packers couldn\u2019t seem to do anything right.\n\nSuddenly Lombardi screams towards his players running off the field, \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on out here?\u201d\n\nRight now, I look around America, and I need to ask: What the hell\u2019s going on here?\n\nThe most anemic recovery in modern history. And Washington? It\u2019s broken for everybody \u2013 at least for everybody who doesn\u2019t make their living inside the Beltway.\n\nWhat the hell\u2019s going on here?!\n\nWe are stuck, stuck in frustration, mired in anger and fear.\n\nAs quarterback, my mission was very simple: to make my teammates better.\n\nOf course, I made a fortune playing football.\n\nMy rookie year in professional football, 1961, I was paid $12,500. So I had a second job every off-season.\n\nAs a small business owner, I feel connected to the millions of Americans in this vital sector of our economy.\n\nAnd let\u2019s look at the facts. Small business in America is the heart and soul of equal opportunity.\n\nThe facts are that 40 percent of the 530,000 start-ups each month are started by African Americans, Hispanics, or Asians.\n\nAlmost a third of small businesses in America are started by immigrants. And nearly 40 percent by women.\n\nBut the thing is, small businesses have been surviving not because of government policies, but in spite of them, especially these past eight years.\n\nHigh taxes.\n\nStrangling regulations.\n\nAnd practically no access to credit.\u00a0 So I ask: What the hell\u2019s going on here?\u00a0\u00a0 Imagine what could happen in our nation if 27 million job-creating enterprises were suddenly empowered and set free in every neighborhood, to grow and build, and contribute\u00a0 even more.\n\nI believe it all comes down to leadership.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Vince Lombardi years ago or, Nick Saban of Alabama today, I can tell you in just five simple words what every great leader does.\n\nA leader gets stuff done.\n\nI\u2019ve known Donald Trump for 48 years.\n\nLike those other leaders I\u2019ve known, he gets stuff done.\n\nHe is a builder.\n\nHe understands that teams win. Individuals don\u2019t.\n\nHe builds great teams.\n\nDonald Trump is a proven leader.\n\nA team builder, Donald Trump knows how to get the best out of all people.\n\nI\u2019ve watched him succeed.\n\nI\u2019ve watched him fail.\n\nI\u2019ve watched him get back up. He never quits.\n\nI believe Donald Trump can provide the leadership that will help us all make America great again.\n\nMake it great for everyone.\n\nLet\u2019s go win this game together.\u00a0 Together, let\u2019s go make America great again.\n\nThank you. Goodnight.\n\n", "I am here speaking tonight in my personal capacity and not on behalf of any of the nonprofit organizations that I lead.\n\nWe have gathered here in Cleveland to select the Republican nominee for president. We have accomplished that mission. Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party. I will be voting for Donald Trump in November, and I will urge my fellow Americans to do the same.\n\nAllow me to explain why. Tonight we focus on making America one again. In the pledge that we just recited, we said we are one nation under God. Congress added the words \u201cunder God\u201d to our pledge of allegiance in 1954.\n\nThe context in which those words were added is instructive. The cold war had begun. As a nation, we faced an existential threat. Children practiced the art of duck and cover in classrooms across the country fearing a nuclear attack.\n\nThe threats to our nation\u2019s survival were as real then as they are today. The difference is, President Eisenhower knew where to place America\u2019s trust. And upon hearing a sermon Reverend George Docherty delivered, President Eisenhower prompted Congress to adopt the words \u201cunder God.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Docherty had pointed to the words of the first Republican PresidentAbraham Lincoln. Speaking to a divided nation at Gettysburg Lincoln said, \u201cunder God, this people shall know a new birth of freedom.\u201d A lot has changed since then, but the source of America\u2019s hope and future has not.\n\nIt is found in the same place today as it was in 1863 and 1954 \u2013 under God.\n\nOur freedom to appeal to and unite under God has been under steady assault. This is why we must stop those in our government and on our courts who have either in principle or in practice attempted to remove these two words, \u201cunder God\u201d\n\nand all that they mean from public life.\n\nFrom his judicial nominees, to his running mate, to the party platform and the policies it promotes, Donald Trump has committed to upholding and protecting this first freedom and therefore our ability as citizens to unite our nation once again under God.\n\nThank you.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nClinton/Kaine: 228\n\nTrump/Pence: 290\n\nDemocrats: 48*(+2)\n\nRepublicans: 52(-2)\n\nDemocrats: 193(+6)\n\nRepublicans: 238(-6)\n\n"], "meta": ["Chelsea Clinton Introducing Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Vice President Joe Biden And Dr. Jill Biden At The Democratic National Convention", "\"Our America\" Block", "Angela Bassett (one of two)", "Beth Mathias", "Brooks Bell", "Capt.
