And he has created and accomplished great things.\\xa0\\xa0 But beyond that this is a man with a big heart.\\n\\nEvery time New York City suffered a tragedy, Donald Trump was there to help.\\n\\nAnd he did it anonymously. (I bet that’s a surprise)\\n\\nYou deserve to know this personal side about our next President.\\xa0 He has been a great father, father-in-law, grandfather and friend to me and my family.\\n\\nHe will keep us safe and help us achieve and embrace our greatness.\\n\\nIn the last seven months, there have been five major Islamic extremist terrorists attacks on us and our allies.\\xa0 We must not be afraid to define our enemy;\\n\\n\n",

Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, and CIA agents Tyrone S. Woods, and Glen Doherty.\\n\\nAnd Clinton, and the Obama administration, for political reasons lied about the purpose of the attacks including her lying directly to the families of those who were killed.\\n\\nHillary Clinton’s answer to Congress about the death of these four brave Americans because of her failures as Secretary of State was “what difference at this point does it make?”\\n\\nWatch the video for yourself and see the arrogant disregard for American lives lost unnecessarily.\\xa0 Make up your own mind.\\n\\nAnyone who can say that it makes no difference how or why people serving America are killed, should not be entrusted with the awesome responsibility to protect them and us and should not be allowed to be our Commander in Chief.\\n\\nWho would trust her to protect them?\\n\\nI do not.\\n\\nDo you?\\n\\nDonald Trump will change all of that.\\n\\nIn short he will lead by leading, not by following.\\n\\nYou know Donald Trump will secure our borders\\nHis opponent has had her chance to do this and failed. Hillary Clinton is for open borders.\\n\\nShe is in favor of taking in Syrian refugees even though the Islamic state\\xa0 has told us they are going to put their operatives in these groups so they can carry out terrorist acts against us and our allies.\\n\\nWe can’t afford to repeat the mistakes of the past.\\n\\nHillary Clinton’s experience is the basis for her campaign.\\xa0 Well, Hillary Clinton’sexperience is exactly the reason she should not be our president.\\n\\nThere is no more time for us left to revive our great country.\\xa0 No more time to repeat our mistakes of the past.\\n\\nWashington needs a complete turnaround and Donald Trump is the agent of change and he will be the leader of the change we need.\\n\\nHe will make America, like the president I worked for Ronald Reagan, once again be the shining City on the Hill.\\n\\nVote for Donald Trump for a safer America and for an America headed in a different direction………Greatness!\\xa0\\xa0God Bless the United States of America.\\n\\n'\n",

    "I recently went with Carolina my wife to witness our youngest daughter Natalia graduate from high school. Natalia knows the sky's the limit.

He uses bankruptcies – six of them – like a wealthy man's get-out-jail-free card. I can't tell you if this man has ever had a callous on his hands. Does he know the price of a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread? And why won't he release his tax returns? What is he hiding? Why won't he show the American people who he is?\n",

    "Let me tell you who Hillary Clinton is. A few months ago, Hillary came to my city of Los Angeles and sat down with people like my parents: grandmothers, DREAMers, and men who work all day in the sun, yet remain in the shadows. As the meeting ended, the crowd swelled around her. She took every photo requested with families who had never been anywhere close to a future President. People who couldn't even vote. She embraced them and consoled them – and she listened to them. It's those moments that make this election personal, that define a President.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hillary I've known for 24 years is someone who has always listened to those who have been silenced. Our next Vice-President Tim Kaine nos escucha también – \"he listens to us too.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We've come a long way from the days when my dad couldn't walk into a restaurant because of signs that read, \"No dogs or Mexicans allowed.\" Now is not the time to turn back. There's a saying in Spanish – Dime con quién andas y te diré quién eres – \"Tell me with whom you walk and I'll tell you who you are.\" Hillary Clinton has walked with us all her life.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter who we are, or where we come from, or what we look like, or how much money we have, or who we love, Hillary Clinton walks with us. So, now, the question is: Are we going to walk with her? Are we going to fight for a nation where love trumps hate? Are we going to build an America that's Stronger Together? \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, together, let's elect the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton!'''"

We were excited that we'd be working together. Then we started talking and figured out that I would be making $8.25 an hour, but Jensen was only offered $8. We are the same age. We were hired for the same job on the same day. And as far as we could tell, we both had the same knowledge of pizza. So we didn't understand why we wouldn't be paid the same amount. \n",

And she never answered my question about why I was going to be paid less. Then our story started getting out. We couldn't believe it when Hillary Clinton tweeted her support for me and shared our story. I may have lost my job, but I'm proud that I spoke up for myself, and I'm glad that Jake stood with me. And we're both glad that Hillary Clinton stood with us.\n",
