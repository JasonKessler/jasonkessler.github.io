The ceramic brakes last a loong time (90K to 100K) , but the front wheel bearing/spindles usually have to be replaced at around 100K due to sealed bearings and the ABS wheel spindle etchings (signal producing encoding ring) are not very deep so rust after several years. These should be made deeper since some folks have gotten ABS fault lights. You can remove the ABS fuse and still drive it, but then no ABS or Stabil-a-Track.

My last 3 cars a 2004 mustang gt, 2005 mustang gt and 2009 vw gti. in comparison this truck is FASTER than the 04 gt and the gti while getting similar mileage. mds works great, i would never notice the switch between 8 and 4 if not for the little eco light on the dash. the ride and handling are excellent as is the refinement. interior design is well thought out and materials are high quality nearly equal to the gti(they are known for interior quality) the sound system is amazing for a \"basic\" truck, good sound quality and volume, low distortion. there are lots of cubbies and storage areas that my last cars lacked. 7 cup holders up front! the styling is very aggressive and handsome. I have modified most of my past cars but i cant think of anything i would change. the 20\" wheels look great but may be hard to keep clean. I am blown away at the value of this truck. its amazing you can purchase this combination for such a low price. a few years ago a ford lighting offered similar performance, power to weight ratio for literally double the price or more, yet lacked the comfort and refinement available in this ram. if you haven\\'t driven one GO NOW TO THE DEALER! every other truck on the market rides like a horse and carriage and none of them have the HEMI. \\n", "favorite_features": "hemi\\nride \\naudio system\\nroom\\n", "review_id": "538194600", "style_id": "101406592", "make": "ram", "base_msrp": "32135", "num_renders": "1", "average_rating": "5", "year": "2012", "model": "1500", "t3_visits": "1", "suggested_improvements": "none.
