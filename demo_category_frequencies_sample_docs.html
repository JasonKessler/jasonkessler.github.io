I 'm Sander Vanocur and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice over Taxes : you do n't need to be a lip reader to hear the talk of new taxes , on cigarettes , gasoline , even a European-style , value-added tax . From Hot Springs , Virginia , this week 's Business World guest , Business Roundtable Chairman Edmund Pratt . And this Mother 's Day , a look a family business , one flushed with success , another with a healthy waistline and bottom line . Also this week , Sandy Weill , successful at Shearson and Primerica . Could he be a force to be reckoned with on Wall Street once again ? And restaurants , trimming prices to beef up lean profits @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World , with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR The T ' word is out of the closet . The word that President Bush told us we would n't have to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word echoing from Capitol Hill to the White House , amplified by estimates as the federal budget deficit for 1991 is galloping toward $100 billion - $36 billion above the Gramm-Rudman Budget Deficit Reduction targets . And as business editor Stephen Aug reports , that 's why the subject is one almost everyone 's lips . STEPHEN AUG : voice-over In Washington these days , the subject is taxes . But that does not always mean income taxes . Sen. ALAN SIMPSON , ( R ) Wyoming : May 8th That 's what people generally think of when they think of taxes . A value-added tax is being discussed , it was n't before . These are the things , there are all sorts of user fees , revenue enhancers , the whole works @!AUG voice-over But the economy has been sluggish for months . Retail sales have fallen for two months in a row . Corporate profits have fallen for the past two quarters . Is it right to raise taxes if it 's true the economy is in a slump ? NORMAN TURE , Economist : If that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should want to put on now is additional taxes . There are no taxes that I can think of that can be raised or newly created that wo n't have an adverse affect on the aggregate volume of economic activity . HENRY AARON , Economist , Brookings Institute : The purpose of raising taxes is to reduce private demands in order to make room - typically , private consumption demands - in order to make room either for added government spending , or , as I think in the current situation , to make room for increased private investment @!AUG voice-over Among the taxes being discussed is a value-added tax , a tax imposed in each stage of production . It could raise more than $310 billion over a five-year period , or a one-percent national sales tax . It could raise $15 billion if it 's imposed just on retail sales , or $30 billion if it 's imposed on a wider variety of goods and services . But some economists say either a sales tax or a value-added tax would be the worst approach . Mr. AARON : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales tax , will entail additional administrative apparatus , a new tax collection mechanism . That just is n't worth doing unless you bring it in at a rate sufficient to collect a very sizable amount of revenue , perhaps more than we need now . Mr. TURE : It would be bad news in economic terms , would be very bad news in terms of the politics , or fiscal policy and budget policy @!AUG voice-over So-called sin taxes , those on cigarettes and alcohol : doubling the cigarette tax could raise about $3 billion a year . Raising the tax on beer and wine could raise an additional $5 billion a year . Raising the gasoline tax might bring the government $1 billion for every additional penny a gallon . Recent proposals would raise the tax a total of 50 cents . That might raise $50 billion a year . If the gasoline tax were structured to reach a total of 50 cents a gallon , Ture says the effects on the economy could be staggering . Mr. TURE : That tax would be absolutely disastrous at this juncture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in costs for everybody , and notice , you 'd be doing it at a time when the economy is not behaving in a very sturdy way @!AUG voice-over A $5-a-barrel tax on imported oil , this might raise about $8 billion a year . Taxing alcohol , cigarettes and energy might have socially redeeming values as well . Mr. AARON : Taxes on alcohol and tobacco would bring health benefits . Taxes on energy would reduce our use of a wasting diminishing resource , and also in some measure , reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy . GAIL FOSLER , Chief Economist , The Conference Board : There are serious flaws with each one of those proposals . The sin taxes not only hit certain industries , but they also are tremendously regressive , and they 're very much like the consumption taxes , sales taxes , value-added taxes that people talk about , the burden of which falls very heavily on the consumer and the poor consumer @!AUG voice-over For income taxes , one proposal is to raise to 33 percent the top rate for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as $10 billion a year . The income tax appears to be the approach economists think is fairest . This , even though most politicians seem unwilling to tinker with it . Mr. AARON : All things considered , however , I think that remains today the fairest place to go hunting for additional revenues , if we decide that we want to raise taxes @!AUG Some economists contend there are really no good options for raising taxes . One result could be that after a couple of months of talks , both the White House and Congress may reach the same conclusion , though some political economists figure it will be the White House that reaches it first . Sandy ? VANOCUR : Thanks , Steve . In just a minute , the business view of the prospect of new taxes from Business Roundtable Chairman Edmund Pratt . Commercial break VANOCUR : This week 's Business World guest was one of a select few CEOs to be invited to the recent annual trade retreat held by the House of Representatives tax panel , the Ways and Means Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's largest pharmaceutical makers . He 's also chairman of the Business Roundtable , a group of CEOs of the nation 's largest corporations . Edmund Pratt joins us from the meeting of another business organization , The Business Council , at the Homestead Hotel in Hot Springs , Virginia . Mr. Pratt , in the present debate about a change in the tax code , what does business want ? EDMUND PRATT , CEO , Pfizer : Well , Sandy , I guess I have to say first that for the last five years , business in general , and the Roundtable in particular , have been emphasizing to our Congress and to our government that what we believe is by far the most important challenge of problems facing this nation , is the deficit - indeed , the twin deficits , the trade deficit and the budget deficit . So we believe it is absolutely critical that actions be taken to address this , and we 're much encouraged by the fact that it looks like they 're starting to get down to work on it . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , and certainly , particularly businessmen , really believe that the problem is not a question of taxes ; it 's a problem of the fact that we spend too much , and that we must address the budget problem by reducing expenditures . That 's been our position for a long time , it 's true in general about the people in the country . Unfortunately , Americans really do n't have confidence that if we just give more money to Congress they 'll use it to reduce the deficit , but they 'll just spend it for other things @!VANOCUR But the issue before the American people and the Congress and business right now is a need to raise revenue to reduce the deficit . If you raised revenue where there 's a possibility of a recession coming - you 've got high interest rates - does n't this , in the long run , hurt business ? Mr. PRATT : Well , we do believe that increased taxes are not the thing that the nation needs now . We must reduce the deficit . And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise revenue . As I said before , reducing expenditures is the most important thing . Reducing the deficit , of course , would help business , it would tend to reduce interest rates and make investment , cheaper for investment , for business , and make us more competitive on a world-wide basis @!VANOCUR One of the issues that business has been for , of course , is a cut in capital gains . Well , when William Steiger , the late representative from Wisconsin , introduced this in 1972 at the Republican Convention in Miami , it was passed in ' 78 . So from ' 78 to ' 86 , you had a reduction in capital gains . Yet at the same time , this country experienced a great growth in its deficit . Are you concerned that pushing for capital gains now is the wrong way to attack this problem ? Mr. PRATT : Well , my own personal view , and I think in general , business 's , of course , a lowest possible tax on capital gains is a plus for business . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance , and we do not consider that - the business community - to be a critical issue for us now . We believe it 's much more important that we do something to reduce the deficit . If there are to be taxes - and , as I said , we do n't believe that should be the right answer - but if there are to be taxes , I think it is very important that the kind of taxes that the kind of taxes that are chosen are not those that affect the competitiveness of industry , and reduce its ability to be profitable , because if that happens , we will have more people out of work and we 'll be less competitive internationally , and also , as you know , most economists are much concerned that increasing taxes could lead to a recession , which is certainly something we do n't want @!VANOCUR Thank you very much , Mr. Pratt . Thanks for joining us here on Business World . Mr. PRATT : Thank you @!VANOCUR When we come back , a look at Sandy Weill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name looking to make a name for himself all over again ? Commercial break VANOCUR : Turning to the week on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell the Dow Jones Industrials finished the week up by more than 91 points . Last week , our panel of stock market experts from around the country were split . Our panel 's consensus is for an up week ahead . Some of our panelists say Friday 's bond rally could push the market upward . Panelist Al Frank , a Santa Monica-based newsletter publisher , noted the breadth of Friday 's stock market rally . AL FRANK , Investment Adviser : Friday 's market was extremely positive . There were over 20 to 1 , up to down volume , over 1,200 advances , and well over 200 million shares , which would signal a bullish market for the next three to four months , perhaps gaining 15 to 20 percent . We could see Dow 3,200 . Of course , there will be corrections along the way , but people who have been staying out of this market , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice- over One name on Wall Street whose stock has been rising is that of Sanford Weill . The man who turned Shearson into a Wall Street powerhouse is at it again , this time targeting not just Wall Street , but the whole financial services industry @!ANNOUNCER A.L . Williams Video President , chairman and chief executive officer of Primerica , Sandy and Joan Weill @!VANOCUR voice-over Thirty five thousand persons , mostly Southern employees and spouses at term insurer A.L . Williams , made their own way to New Orleans ' Superdome in March to hear New York born and bred Sandy Weill . SANDY WEILL , Chairman , Primerica : When A.L . Williams and Primerica merged in ' 89 to create a new financial services company , I think it set out a new mission , and that mission is to be the leading financial services company in the world by the year 2000 , just 10 years away @!VANOCUR voice- over To achieve that , Weill would be competing against such household name companies as Sears , Prudential and American Express . Now competitors , Weill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Express bought Shearson in 1981 . A couple of years later , Weill resigned. interviewing But you left . Why ? Mr. WEILL : We just had a disagreement on philosophy @!VANOCUR voice-over But Robinson 's influence on Weill was unmistakable . Both men have made their mark on the business and cultural horizon . Today , there 's a recital hall named after the Weills at Carnegie Hall , because he raised the $60 million needed to restore the New York City landmark in 1986 . When Weill left Shearson , Peter Cohen , who was considered his protege , took over . But Cohen moved the firm into riskier businesses that culminated in his role , with Robinson 's blessing and help , as Ross Johnson 's investment banker in his failed $25 billion RJR Nabisco LBO bid. interviewing I take it that you do n't believe in RJR Nabisco deals . Why ? Mr. WEILL : I just have n't believed in borrowing so much money that you have no room for margin for error . I think that- our philosophy , really , is to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice versa @!VANOCUR voice-over As a result , Shearson 's problems became front-page news . Cohen got fired and American Express had to pump in nearly a billion dollars . Then the exquisite irony of Weill looking to buy back the firm he once assembled . ARTHUR LEVITT , former Chairman , American Stock Exchange : It was kind of an emotional appeal for him to go back and show everybody that he could do it once more @!VANOCUR voice-over The deal did n't pan out . But to a group of his own Smith Barney analysts , Weill explained his motivation . Mr. WEILL : And when you see all the competitors around you stumbling , it could have been a fantastic opportunity @!VANOCUR voice-over Weill has cultivated a style that is approachable and informal . No palatial suites of offices , or limos to lunch or business meetings , an atmosphere where people say they can speak their minds , among them legendary trader Lew Glucksman . LEWIS GLUCKSMAN , Vice Chairman , Smith Barney : He knows he will get it from me just the way I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy about telling me things that I do n't want to hear sometimes . JAY CUSHMAN , Managing Director , Morgan Stanley : He likes to talk to people , he likes to talk to people inside his business organization as well as on the outside , and there 's no question about that . But there is , I think , at the same time , a degree of reserve and old-fashioned conservatism that stands in the good stead @!VANOCUR F. Scott Fitzgerald is supposed to have said there are no second acts in American life . Is Sandy Weill about to prove Fitzgerald wrong ? FRANK ZARB , Chairman , Smith Barney : You and I have seen people who are either very intelligent and not very smart , or very smart and not very intelligent . He 's got both of those characteristics . Put that all together and you 've got one exception to Mr. Fitzgerald 's axiom . Mr. WEILL : I think I 'm still a young person . I think I 've learned a lot from what I 've done , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a great company @!VANOCUR When we return , when mommy is a CEO and being mommy 's favorite could mean millions . Commercial break VANOCUR : Today , of course , is Mother 's Day , the day we honor the job our mother 's do all year round . But currying favor with mom takes on extra special meaning when mom is n't only running the house but your company as well . voice-over Manufacturing toilets is not exactly a glamour business . But the Gerber Plumbing Fixture Corporation is a good example of how a family business can survive for generations , despite the fact that most family businesses have a life expectancy of less than 25 years . Founded in 1919 , the company is now run by the founder 's daughter , Harriet Gerber Lewis , age 70 , although she was n't exactly the heir apparent . HARRIET LEWIS , Gerber Plumbing Fixtures : I had never really been in this business . In fact , my father was so strict , no women were allowed in the office until after office hours @!VANOCUR voice-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then 33 , her husband , and her 28-year-old brother Oscar , were left to carry on the business . Ms. LEWIS : When he passed away , it was overwhelming , and I think - I was a quick study @!VANOCUR voice-over Sheila Cluff , trim 54-year-old , faced another kind of trauma , starting a health spa business in Southern California from scratch . SHEILA CLUFF , Founder , Fitness Incorporated : We got together and I mortgaged the house , I think , the kids , the cars . My husband even took a loan against his retirement , and we decided that we would indeed start The Oaks at Ojai . That was about 15 years ago @!VANOCUR voice-over Nor was the Oaks , located in a resort town two hours north of Los Angeles , an overnight success . Ms. CLUFF : We got down to our last $10,000 , and I went down to 83 pounds . I was teaching every fitness class at the Oaks because I needed to save the money @!VANOCUR voice-over Sheila endured with the help of her family , added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business with 200 employees and a gross of $9 million a year . Harriet , the president of Gerber since 1983 , has also been successful . The Chicago-based company has four factories , 1,000 employees and grosses $80 million a year selling a full-line of plumbing fixtures . But both women now face the classic problem of a family business - how to make a smooth transition of control to the next generation . The experts say that requires the offspring be groomed to take over . PETER DAVIS , Wharton Family Business Institute : When they get into their middle-late 30s , the succession process becomes very serious and the need for them to have some real power and take over the business becomes part of an urgent agenda in the family 's planning . Ms. LEWIS : About two years ago , I had spoken to my son about succession and would he be interested in assuming this role . He was n't ready then , and we talked about it , and I said to him , \" When you 're ready , we 'll talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her son Alan said he was ready . Now he 's the president . ALAN LEWIS , Son : We 've gotten along . We 've had battles , but we get along , and we each seem to do our own business a little differently . Ms. LEWIS : My son is a good administrator , and he never knew much about manufacturing but he 's learning now @!VANOCUR voice-over Out in California , it 's the daughters who are learning the business . Joslyn , 39 , is chief financial officer . Cathy , 23 , is director of human resources . As part of the training , they had to apply for the jobs . CATHY CLUFF , Daughter : I had to go through interviews with the general manager , we had to work on a job description . And so it was n't just walking through the door and having an instant job @!VANOCUR voice- over But can such hard-driving businesswomen - Sheila Cluff , Harriet Lewis - ever give up their control easily ? Ms. LEWIS : I 'm not retiring , but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get tired but I 'm not going to retire . Ms. CLUFF : I plan to never retire , and turn the logistics of the pool filters breaking down , and all the electricity going off , and the employee manuals having to be put on computers , all of that , I plan to turn over to my children @!VANOCUR In a minute , restaurants try to fatten up their bottom lines by putting their prices on a diet . Commercial break VANOCUR : Mother 's Day is the biggest single day for restaurant eating , as families try to give mom a break from the kitchen . Restaurants probably wish it was Mother 's Day every day . Many are still feeling the impact of both the stock market crash in 1987 and the change in the tax law , which limited the benefit of the expense account lunch . In New York , business at the famous Four Seasons was down six percent ; at other restaurants , even more , forcing some trendy eateries to tighten their belts . LEE FRIEDMAN , Restaurant Owner : They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions and they 're very expensive . \" VANOCUR : voice-over They also remembered not to come back , and after business dropped 60 percent , owner Lee Friedman re-named the once-trendy Melrose . The neighborhood restaurant is now called the Barrow Street Bistro . Mr. FRIEDMAN : Now it 's just not a big deal . You could come in here today and buy a two-course meal for $10 . You could buy a two-course meal for $15 @!VANOCUR voice-over Friedman 's experience has been repeated at other , once very trendy , high-priced restaurants around the country , where owners are finding that lower prices can mean higher profits . MICHAEL McCARTY , Restaurant Owner : When you cut the prices in the beginning , if nobody knows about it , you continue to do your same population of clientele every evening . Once the word got out that I did that , then we had a lot more people coming up @!VANOCUR voice-over Entrees at McCarty 's Santa Monica restaurant used to cost from $26 to $32 . Today , just $16 to $24 . In Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pavillon has cut prices 10 to 20 percent . JANET CAM , Director , Le Pavillon : For the local clientele , to stimulate business there have been special dinners that are almost introductory prices at 55 pre fix with multiple choice @!VANOCUR voice-over At Chicago 's Claim Company , located in a shopping mall , the new trend is casual . The restaurant changed to a casual , cowboy motif , helping it to recover lost business . CLARK WOLF , Food and Restaurant Consultant : These days , after the crash , things are a little bit calmer . So to be trendy today , you have to be a little bit old fashioned @!VANOCUR That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Sander Vanocur . On behalf of everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223860 @!SANDER-VANOCUR : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur , and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice-over DARPA , from high tech weapons to computers , the Pentagon 's research arm is funding new technology . Why has it become a political hot potato ? From Austin , Texas , this week 's Business World guest , Dr. Robert Noyce , CEO of the semiconductor consortion , Sematech . Also this week , paying the price for research and development . Companies like Amgen devote plenty to R&amp;D , why does Wall Street look askance ? And a profile of an R&amp;D scientist . Intel 's Justin Ratner thinks inventing computers is just ducky @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World , with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR One of the major disputes likely to arise during the White House congressional budget talks is the over $295 billion proposed for defense . Yet one item in the defense budget has prompted a sort of role reversal . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or increased funding of the Pentagon 's main research arm , the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency , DARPA , while the administration tries to hold the line overall , but wants to see a DARPA cut . While corporate research and development , over the past decade , has grown by 50 percent , defense R&amp;D is up by 92 percent . Why has the Pentagon R&amp;D become a political hot potato ? In part , it 's a matter of , whose policy is this anyway ? JAMES ROTTSOLK , CEO , Tera Computer : We have been funded by DARPA for the last year and a half . And without DARPA 's support , we would not have made nearly the progress we 've been able to make @!VANOCUR voice-over Tera Computer is designing a new supercomputer . By the time it gets off the drawing board , Tera hopes it will be the fastest of its type , by using chips made from a substance faster and more efficient than the silicon used in today 's computers . Called gallium arsenide , it 's the backbone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman , Gazelle Microcircuits : Recently , DARPA put $4 million of new capital in for the development of new technologies , primarily for data communication circuits , fiber optic communication circuits @!VANOCUR voice-over DARPA 's investment in Gazelle was the first under a new program authorized by Congress , which may actually let the Pentagon get a dollar return on its investment if the company is financially successful . But it was the last made by Dr. Craig Fields before he was transferred out of his job as director of DARPA to a less visible Pentagon post . Sen. ALBERT GORE , ( D ) , Tennessee : His superiors in the Bush administration had just been so committed to not letting the government get involved in this in any way , that they just decided to fire him , to make an example out of him @!VANOCUR voice-over It 's not only computers and chips that benefit from DARPA 's $1.2 billion budget . The agency funds a wide range of projects , from those with primarily defense applications , like anti- submarine warfare and advanced fighters , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , and among it 's most controversial , high- definition television . Rep. GEORGE BROWN , ( D ) , California : I do n't think we can ever catch up with the Japanese unless we make major changes of the sort that Greg Fields was trying to make over there @!VANOCUR voice-over DARPA 's policies of promoting new technologies have become the center of a dispute between members of Congress - who favor a government role for encouraging specific industries to keep the US competitive - and conservatives - both in and out of the administration - who do n't . WILLIAM NISKANEN , Chairman , CATO Institute : I do not want the government promoting particular technologies on the assumption that these technologies are going to be the ones in which we 're going to be good at 15 , 20 years from now . Sen. GORE : Some people have a commitment to a laissez-faire ideology that 's almost a religious commitment . They do n't want the federal government to do anything , even in an area like national defense , where we need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be important in the future @!VANOCUR voice-over The debate is particularly heated , because the Pentagon , while proposing to boost overall defense spending next year , by almost $4 billion , wants to cut $100 million out of DARPA 's budget . Dr. GEORGE HEILMEIER , former Director , DARPA : The systems that we do procure must be superior in their quality to those of any potential adversary . So I think high technology- The kind of high technology that 's fostered by DARPA will become increasingly important , even in a declining defense budget environment @!VANOCUR voice-over The debate focuses on whether DARPA is the right place to support new technologies , or if government should be in that business at all . Rep. BROWN : DARPA has focused on those areas vital to defense , and also those areas which are described as dual use areas , vital to both defense and the civilian economy . We now need to have an agency which looks at those which may not have a defense application . Mr. NISKANEN : The issue is whether a policy is likely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to produce successes than failures . Now the overall record of American government support of technology has really been rather bleak @!VANOCUR voice-over Still , DARPA has sponsored a number of technologies with commercial promise , among them , the national aerospace plane and parallel processing computers . Gazelle 's Jerry Crowley feels that DARPA 's money can also make the promise of gallium arsenide devices into a commercial success . Mr. CROWLEY : There 's a whole host of applications that are using our products , both for military and commercial value @!VANOCUR Business World asked representatives of the administration and the Pentagon to appear in this report , but they declined . Dr. Craig Field said he would appear if his Pentagon superiors approved . They did not . In just a minute , the head of one company hoping R&amp;D will keep an entire industry in the chips . Sematech CEO , Dr. Robert Noyce . Commercial break VANOCUR : This week 's Business World guest is a legend . The co-inventor of the device which sparked the computer revolution , the microchip , he founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry consortion designed to advance semiconductor manufacturing . Sematech CEO , Dr. Robert Noyce , joins me and my colleague , Stephen Aug , from ABC affiliate , KVUE , in Austin , Texas . Dr. Noyce , at the bottom of this dispute about whether the private sector or the government should invest in high tech , is n't the real issue that we have n't got enough capital in this country to invest ? Dr. ROBERT NOYCE , CEO , Sematech : That 's certainly one of them . Our savings rate is so low that it 's a lot more attractive for other countries to invest in American high tech than it is for Americans @!VANOCUR Is the government a better judge of what 's required , in terms of economic national interest , than the private sector ? Dr. NOYCE : Well , I think the private sector is going to pick what they should work on . On the other hand , I think the government should be interested in who wins , whether it 's the Americans or the foreigners . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than having them overseas . STEPHEN AUG , ABC News : The Defense Advance- DARPA , the Defense Advance Research Project Agency , part of the defense department , they have been criticized in some areas for wanting to look into high definition TV . To what extent should this agency be allowed to investigate or do research in areas that could have primarily civilian applications ? Dr. NOYCE : Well , I think that the military obviously is now dependent , totally , on dual-use technologies . If a basic commercial technology is n't available , it wo n't be available for the defense department to use , either . The semiconductor industry is a good example of that . The defense department uses nine percent of the output in the industry . So most of the R&amp;D in the industry is supported by the commercial market . Therefore , the industry has to be strong in the commercial market , in order to make the defense needs available @!AUG So , in effect , your answer is , yes , they should be involved in research that may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think in order for them to carry out their mission , which is to be sure that the technology is available for our military , they 're going to have to get involved in the general question of the defense industrial base and the strength of that manufacturing sector and that technological sector @!AUG Let me ask you one question about Sematech . It 's almost two years old . Aside from getting everything set up and getting everybody working together , have there been any major scientific advances so far ? Dr. NOYCE : Remember , Sematech is a manufacturing consortion . Our science has been good in the semiconductor area . But the Japanese , in particular , have targeted this area and taken away the high-volume production . That 's the commercial base on which R&amp;D rests . So the answer to our problem in semiconductors is to get manufacturing back in the U.S. So we 've been working on that technology . Yes , we have made several advances significant in terms of the through put efficiency and reliability of our production equipment @!VANOCUR When you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector , or are you talking about the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ? Dr. NOYCE : It 's obviously a combination of the two . The private sector gets together , decides what should be done . Media endorses that and promotes the consortion in Japan to promote that particular industry that the private sector has agreed upon @!VANOCUR It is said in the White House , John Sununu , the chief of staff , Darman , the budget director , and Michael Boskin , the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , opposes DARPA . Do you know why they oppose government help to the private sector , in high tech ? Dr. NOYCE : I do n't think they oppose DARPA . They have had a problem with doing commercial activities . But I think that what we need to emphasize again is that our defense capabilities depend upon the commercial success of the private sector . We 're in a battle here , which is now largely economic , not military . And we need to support and be sure that the American industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to @!VANOCUR Thank you very much , Dr. Noyce . Thanks for joining us here on Business World . Dr. NOYCE : Thank you for allowing us @!VANOCUR When we come back , the stock market and corporate R&amp;D . Sometimes a healthy research budget is no prescription for a stock 's success . Commercial break VANOCUR : Research and development , R&amp;D , the things corporations do to create new products and get them into market . But all too often , R&amp;D is considered expendable to help improve the short-term bottom line , a trend that 's starting to show . In the twenty-year period from 1967 to 1987 , R&amp;D , as a percentage of gross national product , dropped in the U.S. , while growing significantly in Japan and West Germany . But as business editor , Stephen Aug reports , sometimes bucking that trend line pays off @!AUG voice-over When Grant Bennett was 15 years old , his kidneys failed . A year later , he underwent a transplant from his mother . That worked for six and a half years . Now he 's 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's been back on kidney dialysis , five hours a day , three days a week . It was discouraging , at least until he began taking a new drug called Ephigan , which helps produce red blood cells . GRANT BENNETT , Kidney Disease Victim : It 's meant a great improvement in my lifestyle . And this will be the first summer that I 've really been feeling the effects of the epagin . And I plan to get out and really enjoy the summer , as opposed to the past few summers that I really have n't felt like doing anything @!AUG voice-over Epagin came on the market just one year ago . It was developed by Amgen , one of a growing number of biotechnology firms . To develop epagin and other pharmaceuticals , Amgen spends almost 90 percent of sales dollars on research , the highest percentage of any American corporation , according to the most recent Business Week survey . GORDON BINDER , CEO , Amgen Corporation : The lesson is that well conceived , well executed R&amp;D pays off very , very handsomely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors , nurses and pharmacists , our customers . It pays off for employees ; it creates jobs . And it pays off for the investors who provide the money in the first place @!AUG voice-over When Amgen needed money for research , like other small new companies , it sought out a partner . It found Johnson &amp; Johnson . In return for money , Amgen gave Johnson &amp; Johnson distribution rights . IRA LOSS , Vice President , Washington Analysis Corporation : What happened later down the line was that Amgen discovered they had a blockbuster of a product . And suddenly the deal that looked good to them when they needed the money for the research and development , did n't look like such a good deal now , when all they were going to get was a royalty from the Johnson &amp; Johnson sales @!AUG voice-over Amgen may also be an advertisement for those who say Wall Street rewards heavy spending on R&amp;D . Recently , it 's been trading around its record high . Mr. BINDER : Equity investors have put in about $200 million into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now worth $1.2 billion , at the current stock price . So , in our case , at least , R&amp;D has certainly rewarded those investors who gave us the money to do the R&amp;D in the first place @!AUG voice- over But that does not always happen . Take the case of Merck and company , the huge pharmaceutical firm . Last November , Merck announced a big increase in research and development , up 14 percent to $855 million . That would hurt near term profits . The result : the stock price plunged nearly $4 a share the same day . And that was not the first time R&amp;D expenses hurt Merck 's stock performance . Another was back in the 1970s . Mr. LOSS : Merck sacrificed short-term earnings for several years , and put tremendous amounts of money into research and development . The stock was out of favor for a very long time . And then , suddenly , the pipeline started to fill up and products started burping out @!AUG voice-over The result : by the mid- ' 80s , Merck stock took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For most of American industry , outside of pharmaceuticals and some high technology firms , research and development expense averages less than 3.5 percent of sales . But America 's foreign competition is spending about a third more . One reason is a short-term outlook at many American firms , says Congressman Mel Levine , who 's active in high technology causes . He 's called for tax changes . Rep. MEL LEVINE , ( D ) , California : And if you have actually held a productive asset for five years or more , you should have a very low tax , which will encourage long- term holdings . But if you are involved in short-term , speculative investments , we might consider taxing those profits at an even higher rate than we currently do @!AUG Levine has also introduced legislation to create a Technology Corporation of America , sort of a U.S. version of Japan 's influential Ministry of International Trade and Industry . But do n't look for support from the Bush administration ; it opposes virtually any government attempt to single out any industry for special help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the record week on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell , the Dow Jones Industrials finished the week up by more than 18 points , hitting new highs on three out of five trading days . Last week , our panel of stock market experts from around the country predicted an up week . Our panelists consensus is for a down week ahead . Some of our panelists expect the market to consolidate before moving up . Panelist Lou Holland , a Chicago-based money manager is particularly bullish about bonds . LOUIS HOLLAND , Investment Adviser : Well , I like bonds . On a shorter-term basis , I think it 's possible that the long government bond will move back above 9 percent . But I think if we look out over the next 6 to 18 months , I think bonds will generate a higher rate of return than common stocks @!VANOCUR When we return , one R&amp;D scientist who does n't monkey around with his formula for success . Commercial break VANOCUR : At the front lines of research and development are the R&amp;D scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and short nerds . That 's not always true . Take the case of one successful computer engineer who does n't even own a pocket protector , much less , a white lab coat . JUSTIN RATNER , Director , Technology Intel : If you 're seeking new answers to scientific problems , you 've got to get your hands on the fastest computer available . And I think it 's now clear that the fastest computers being built are parallel supercomputers @!VANOCUR voice-over When chip and computer maker , Intel , introduced its newest supercomputer , the big pitch came not from its marketing director , but from its director of technology , Justin Ratner . He 's considered one of the founders of a new generation of computers that take large , complex problems - like the way molecules fit together - then breaks them down into smaller problems , solves them , and then delivers the solution . GARY SMABY , Supercomputer Analyst : Its not unlike Tom Sawyer , you know , getting all of his friends to help paint the fence . It gets the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job apart @!VANOCUR voice-over In recognition of his contributions , Research and Development magazine named Ratner R&amp;D scientist of the year . And Intel made him an Intel Fellow , it 's highest technical position . GORDON MOORE , Chairman , Intel : He 's influenced Intel to go in some major technical directions , and really has had a major impact on a lot of our products @!VANOCUR voice-over When he 's not on the road or being a visionary at Intel 's Scientific Computer Group in Beaverton , Oregon , Ratner tries to squeeze in as much time as possible with his wife and three children . That means frequent outings , and no computer in the house to monkey around with , for himself or the kids . Not every project he 's worked on has been ducky . A computer based on this microprocessor , the IX-432 was , by some estimates , a $20 million flop . Mr. MOORE : It was a case of a project that Justin guided , where we were really working on the new frontiers of knowledge . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice-over Justin Ratner 's latest computer is capable of outperforming some supercomputers many times its size and its price . The machine is part of a project partially funded by DARPA . Mr. RATNER : DARPA is interested in accelerating the rate at which high-performance computers become available , not only for the aerospace defense markets , but also in the commercial markets @!VANOCUR voice-over Working toward the next generation machine , Ratner keeps his engineering and marketing team up to speed , with the latest developments in technology , which , in turn , helps Intel speed the next generation of fast computers to market . Those many supercomputers are already being used by pharmaceutical firms to help develop new drugs . They 're being used to help design freighters to better withstand the high seas . And they 're even developing new financial instruments for Prudential-Bache . Mr. RATNER : We 're just starting to see supercomputers come to Wall Street . And I think that , again , is going to have a significant effect on people who normally do n't think of computers as being part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve airline crew and equipment scheduling . Mr. SMABY : What that means to the non-computer person , if you will , is that there are going to be more on time flights , there 's going to be quicker response in the event of equipment failures @!VANOCUR voice-over And if , as he believes , Ratner 's machines can make the airlines run on time , that might make him a techno-hero . Mr. SMABY : There are probably a half dozen names- recognizable names from Steve Jobs to Seymour Cray to Jean Amdol that have kind of taken on that folk hero status . And I think Justin is earning that . Mr. RATNER : Whether I 'm a hero or not , I guess the success of our business and of parallel computing in general , will have to determine @!VANOCUR We 'll be right back . Commercial break VANOCUR : And finally , proof that the first effort to save the savings and loans did n't save the investors . The Resolution Trust Corporation says it 's taking over Southwest Savings Association , owned by Caroline Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money into failing Texas S&amp;Ls , a plan which may have cost the government $2 billion and Hunt , a hefty $25 million . That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Sander Vanocur . On behalf of everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223861 @!SANDER-VANOCUR : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice over Doing business with the Soviet Union . Despite perestroika , profits from joint ventures can still wind up in red tape . From Boston , this week 's Business World guest , one winner of the ruble prize , economist Franklyn Holzman . Will the Soviets convert to his currency theory ? And Hungary , Eastern Europe 's success story - while western businesses jump in , some Americans have cold feet . Also , Apples for Students , a supermarket promotion gets computers into schools . And audio books - having someone read a not at bedtime ' story goes big time @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World , with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR Even as Soviet leader Mikail Gorbachev met with President Bush , back at home , Moscovites have been lining up to buy goods in nearly empty stores , fearing that new goods will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , the new trade agreement with the U.S. American firms have primarily been doing business in the Soviet Union through joint ventures , but , as business editor Stephen Aug reports , Americans are learning that not all joint ventures are created equal . STEPHEN AUG , ABC News : voice-over When McDonald 's opened its Moscow restaurant , its first in the Soviet Union , this past January , the crowds mobbed the place . It 's part of a joint venture that 's planning to open 20 McDonald 's , eventually . Just getting the first one open took 12 years of effort . And while just about everybody says it 's a big success , not every joint venture is . Consider the Satra Corporation , a trading company in New York whose founder and President , Ara Oztemel has been operating in the Soviet Union for nearly 40 years . He remembers the board of directors ' meetings . ARA OZTEMEL , Chairman , Satra Corporation : The resolutions were made and agreements were made , but quickly we found out that these were never recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because we 'd agree on something , and things would happen totally contrary , and we 'd talk about this , they 'd say , \" Yeah , we discussed it , but subsequent events changed our minds . \" AUG : voice- over Lesson number one , in a joint venture , make sure all sides know the ground rules early . But even more basic for any venture in the Soviet Union is how to get your profits out . The ruble is not convertible into any hard currency , and even a Soviet customer may have no control over payments . Mr. OZTEMEL : The customer not only would agree , but the customer would also deposit the money with the bank , but that , nowadays , does n't necessarily mean that the bank will pay out @!AUG voice-over Lesson number two , make sure any arrangement clearly lays out how to take your profits out , even though that might not be in cash . WILLIAM FORRESTER , U.S.-U.S.S.R . Trade and Economic Council : If you 're in a joint venture , perhaps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency market to a third country . Perhaps you would take back product that you could sell @!AUG voice-over Pepsico is one major example of this . In return for shipping in concentrate for Soviet-owned Pepsi-Cola bottling plants , Pepsi has the exclusive U.S. distribution rights for Stolichnaya vodka . It 's been a successful arrangement that 's been operating since 1974 . An alternative is to open a business , like a hotel , that deals in hard currency . The Radisson Hotel chain , part of the Carlson Companies of Minneapolis , will open the first U.S.- managed hotel in the Soviet Union later this year . It will be in Moscow , and they expect immediate profits . JUERGEN BARTELS , President , Carlson Hospitality Group : This is one of the highest occupancy cities in the world . Average room rates are high , so we are- and we are an infrastructure item of the future @!AUG voice-over Lesson number three , expect to spend lots of money . DENNIS ORWIG , ABB U.S.S.R. Business Development : It 's very hard to make a trip from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than $10,000 or $15,000 . And that 's not living extravagantly @!AUG voice-over And the level of service in some Soviet hotels is not all that good . Mr. ORWIG : You have to have guaranteed reservations on top of guarantees , and then , nine times out of 10 , when you literally walk up to the reservation desk , they say , \" We 've never heard of you . \" AUG : voice-over Once in the Soviet Union , a businessman certainly will need information . One way to get it is through a new weekly newspaper called Commersant . It 's printed both in Russian and in English . It offers tips on who 's visiting Moscow , current exchange rates and upcoming trade fairs . It 's part of a joint venture between Refco , the American commodity trading firm , and a group led by Vladimir Yakovlev . What he says is tantamount to lesson number four , know your market . VLADIMIR YAKOVLEV , Editor-In-Chief , \" Commersant \" : If I would try to sell Russian clothing in New York , right- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well- when we go- the American businessman whose idea was to sell in the Soviet Union sausages without meat thought he was sure that it is great commercial idea , and you have to tell him that , you know , all the sausages which we have here is without meat @!AUG voce-over Lesson number five , be prepared for surprises - like Combustion Engineering , now a unit of ABB Brown Boveri of Switzerland . For three years , they 've had a joint venture making automation controls for the petrochemical industry , said to be the most profitable joint venture in the U.S.S.R. But not long ago , they shipped some personal computers , like this , to the Soviet Union . But they disappeared , only to wind up in a hospital in another city . Mr. ORWIG : And when we asked the president of the joint venture , who was a Soviet citizen , why , his answer was , \" Well , the hospital needed them , and this hospital is in a city where we might want to work some day . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" AUG : voice- over Lesson number six , almost everything American may have a market in the Soviet Union , even that most American of businesses , advertising . For instance , in Moscow , where they have 14,000 buses and trams , there 's now a joint venture with TDI , a transit advertising firm in New York . HOWARD ZIFF , International Managing Director , TDI : When you go there , as I was , you see that wherever you look is a bus , a trolley or a tram . It 's that important to them . Therefore , to put advertising on these vehicles is going to be overwhelmingly impacting @!AUG Most businessmen who 've been there say doing business in the Soviet Union is complicated ; it take a lot of time . And with the Soviet economy and government in chaos , it 's becoming even more difficult . Well , the upside , of course , is a potential market of 300 million consumers , most of whom will like all the American products and services they can get . Sandy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll talk to economist Franklyn Holzman , who thinks he may have one solution to the Soviet economic crisis . Commercial break VANOCUR : One of the major problems facing the Soviet economy is its currency . The government-established value of the ruble and its true worth are so far out of alignment as to make it useless in international trade . To help find a solution , an American multimillionare named Fred Furth offered more than $40,000 in a so-called ruble prize . This past week , the first prize was awarded to two Soviets and this week 's Business World guest , economist Franklyn Holzman of Tufts University , who joins us from the ABC News Bureau in Boston . Professor Holzman , given the nature of the problem , and the time constraints on Gorbachev , has he already missed the boat in terms of economic reform ? FRANKLYN HOLZMAN , Ruble Prize Winner : Well , I guess he's- the door is- I do n't think the door is quite closed , but it 's certainly pushing hard on him now , largely for political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got Lithuania and the other Baltic states trying to get away from the Soviet Union . But he also has a number of economic problems and , to some extent , these economic problems are political . For example , one of the things that he should do is stop subsidizing consumers goods . The largest expenditure of the state budget is for subsidies to keep the prices of food products low . They spend approximately 100 billion rubles a year now on subsidies to consumer goods . That 's actually larger than their defense budget @!AUG Mr. Holzman , in Poland , they faced a similar problem , obviously on a smaller scale - it 's a much smaller country . They had a massive inflation when they tried to move away from subsidies . Would that sort of inflation also cause deeper political problems in the Soviet Union ? Prof. HOLZMAN : Well , I think it would . The only reason that the Polish government was able to do what it did was because they had Solidarity backing them , that is , they were Solidarity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to raise prices to get rid of the subsidies to consumer goods , and the government fell . In 1976 , again , an attempt was made to raise prices of consumer goods and , again , the government fell . And I think that it 's very possible that if Gorbachev tried to do it- well , it would be a very risky procedure . But I think he almost has to try it very , very shortly @!AUG With the Soviet economy in such bad shape , is there anything that the United States should be doing to help the Soviet economy or help the Soviets over this hurdle , lest the Soviet Union break up ? Is there something we should be doing , or should we just stay out of it ? Prof. HOLZMAN : Well , I do n't think there 's much that we can do . I think we should give them Most Favored Nation treatment , and I think it 's ridiculous that the Congress and some of the other people in the government want to withhold it over Lithuania . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are in the process of making more technology available to them . But , basically , they have to do their own job . I mean , Gorbachev , I think , has got to bite the bullet very soon or he 's going to be finished @!VANOCUR All right , now that you 're a very wealthy capitalist , given your prize money , would you invest your money in the Soviet Union unless they accomplish convertibility ? Prof. HOLZMAN : Well , I don't- well , I suppose , if I were- I do n't know what I would do , because I 'm a very conservative man , financially , never having had enough money to be radical about it . But I can see that if I were someone attempting to start a joint venture there , I would worry very much about the fact that I might not be able to get my money out @!VANOCUR Thank you very much , Professor . Thanks for joining us here on Business World . When we come back , a look at the most westward looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , the rapid transition from controlled economy to free market has been most successful in the nation which was probably best prepared for it . ABC News Correspondent Jim Bitterman reports Hungary 's slide toward a western-style economy has turned into an avalanche . JIM BITTERMAN , ABC News : voice- over Another brisk sales day at a western retail outlet doing business in Eastern Europe , specifically , in the Hungarian capital of Budapest . IKEA , the Swedish home furnishing outift , has become an overnight success here . But how can the company ever hope to turn a hard currency profit by ringing up soft currency sales ? Well , it 's not that complicated , because IKEA buys about a quarter of the products it sells worldwide from East European suppliers . So the soft currency it collects in sales goes , in part , to pay for its product line , like the sheets and curtains printed up at this Hungarian textile plant . And , too , IKEA , like the businessmen who crowd the hotels here , figures that the investment risk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door which could lead to large , new markets . But with some exceptions , American businessmen have not left the impression they are so ready to invest . They seem more content just to turn over what sales they can . That , according to a U.S. Ambassador who led a task force through Hungary , Czechoslovakia , East Germany and Rumania , could be a mistake . Amb . DIANA LADY DOUGAN , U.S. State Department Task Force : And they made a big point - they 're not looking for assistance . They want investment ; they want expertise ; they want know-how ; and they want Americans in there @!BITTERMAN voice-over American tardiness may be costly . There are signs that it may become tougher to do business here . The French bought this state-of-the-art research lab from a Hungarian collective farm a year ago . Today , the farm 's management is much more leery of such deals , more afraid their workers , who earn just 50 cents an hour , may be exploited , and more inclined to search harder for their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are moving in here know there will be difficulties , but they 're confident nonetheless . BRYAN GERRISH , Vice President , Fusion Corporation : We 're in a situation right now where , you know- we 're looking at two or three years down the road , and we think being here now is very exciting , to be here now , and we think in two or three years , it 's going to pay off for us @!BITTERMAN voice-over Not all of capitalism 's explorers who 've headed east will discover riches in the old world , but those who come seem convinced it 's better to be here now than not to be . Jim Bitterman , ABC News , Budapest @!VANOCUR When we return , supermarkets pushing Apples , the computer variety . Commercial break VANOCUR : Turning to the record week on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell , the Dow Jones Industrials finished the week up by more than 80 points , breaking the 2,900 barrier for the first time . Our panel of stock market experts from around the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the strength of the bond market to continue pushing stocks up . But panelist Peter Eliades , a Los Angeles-based market timer , is concerned because the secondary stocks are not benefitting from the current rally . PETER ELIADES , Market Timer : I think if we do go further , it 's going to be , basically , a Dow Jones Industrial Average rally and , if that 's the case , then one has to be very , very selective in terms of their stock picking . So the next three to five months in the market , I believe , will continue to see the formation of a very major stock market drop , and people should be very careful in terms of any stocks that they wish to purchase @!VANOCUR Among the hot performers in the current rally have been computer stocks . IBM announced at the end of the week a new contract with the Soviet Union for 13,000 personal computers . The deal is the largest ever between IBM and the Soviets , worth an estimated $20 million to $30 million . The joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IBM assembly operation in the U.S.S.R. The PCs are targeted for Soviet schools . ABC News Correspondent Greg Dobbs reports it 's the U.S. schools that are the target of a promotion by IBM and Apple which appears to be a win/win/win situation for the schools , computer makers , and some supermarkets . GREG DOBBS , ABC News : voice-over Sonya Bond went down to the local Safeway to buy some cheese , some bread , some apples , and , by saving her receipt , another computer for her daughter 's elementary school . Centennial Elementary is one of 50,000 public and private schools - that 's nearly half of all schools in the country - that have participated in the nationwide program \" Apples for Students . \" on camera Here 's how the system works . Once a school has accumulated enough receipts , it turns them into the supermarket and through a middleman , who gets a substantial educational discount , the Apple Company , the supermarket chain buys the computer for the school . If it collects , say , $70,000 worth of receipts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at Centennial Elementary . Everyone involved with this calls it a win/win situation . COLIN CONWAY , Principal , Centennial School : This is so simple a process , and that 's why it was easy for us to buy in . BOB GREENE , Vice President , Safeway : It 's really done better than some of our past promotions and , yet , it 's a way to help the schools . JOHN CONNELLY , J. Edward Connelly Associates : It 's a goose laying a golden egg . It just does n't stop @!DOBBS voice-over Marketing mogul John Connelly is the middleman . The golden egg was hatched in his firm . He has had 39 supermarket chains in 43 states take part in the program and its profits . Mr. CONNELLY : We have all- results all the way from 3 percent to 15 percent gain and in a supermarket chain , a one percent increase in sales is considered phenomenal . BARRY SCHER , Vice President , Public Affairs , Giant Food : What 's the best food store in Bowie ? KIDS : Giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer loyalty among its profits , too . Recently , it awarded three Apple 2C color system computers to Rockledge Elementary in Bowie , Maryland , which redeemed a quarter million dollars worth of Giant Food receipts . Each computer , plus the software that automatically comes with it , could have cost the school more than $1,300 . Instead , to Rockledge , they were free . And to Giant , worth the cost . Mr. SCHER : Like any promotional program , it certainly is an expense . We have staff , we have advertisements on radio and television and in the newspaper to help promote the program @!DOBBS voice-over And , of course , there 's the cost of computers themselves . It 's projected that , this year , participating supermarket chains nationwide will give away $40 million in various kinds of Apple computers and accessories . The payoff ? Not just profit , but PR . Mr. GREENE : Any time you can get your name in the public 's eye and start creating interest in your stores , it 's a good situation for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep buying at participating sotres , these programs will go on indefinitely . Receipts for computers . That 's food for thought . Greg Dobbs , ABC News , Denver @!VANOCUR In a minute , we 'll tell you a story about books for people with no time to read .

It 's very hard , tough , concentrated work . And it 's not easy , I must tell you . DAN ROTH , Publisher , Simon &amp; Schuster : This is an electronic greatgrandchild , if you will , of the campfire , and I think there 's something very primitive about it @!VANOCUR voice-over But while listening was once a full-time activity , today , it 's just another way to do more than one thing at a time . LYNN GILBERT , Photographer : It 's very boring doing laps , and this way , your mind is focused on something that 's very entertaining . It 's opened a new way of life for me . JENNY FROST , Publisher , Bantam Audio Books : It turns , you know , commuting time , which is usually considered down time , either into entertainment time or a chance to learn something new .

JANE FRIEDMAN , Publisher , Random House : This doctor wrote to us to say he of course knew that Lincoln had been assassinated , but when he heard it on tape , he also nearly went off the road . We do suggest that you pay attention to the road while you 're listening to the tapes in cars @!VANOCUR voice-over With an average three-hour tape retailing for about $15 , the industry expects sales to be upwards of a quarter billion dollars this year . Mr. ROTH : The hardware was in place and a demand for software came about , so certainly , the last five years have seen a very dramatic growth in the whole spoken word marketplace @!VANOCUR voice- over And publishers agree the current challenge is to expand beyond the bookstore . JAMES BRANNIGAN , Director of Sales , Rivertown : We 're going after the gift trade , the record trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going @!VANOCUR voice-over That 's why you can now find books on tape in places like the Iowa 80 truck stop . Ms. FROST : Truckers are on the road , and they have a lot of disposable income and truck stops are being used more and more by business and vacationers as well @!VANOCUR voice-over Many no doubt business travelers listening to some sound advice , but keeping an ear to the grindstone. on camera That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Sander Vanocur , on behalf of everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223862 @!SANDER-VANOCUR : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice-over Democrats open fire on the Bush administration 's handling of the S&amp;L bailout . Is the government hiring the wrong people and paying them too much to manage the crisis ? From Washington , this week 's Business World guest , the chairman of the House task force on the bailout , Congressman Bruce Vento . Also , some high-tech companies find a low- tech way to reduce chemical damage to the ozone layer . Was the Penn Central bankruptcy the best medicine for the railroad industry ? And a success story that really suits Father 's Day : a family business passed on from father to sons to grandsons @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World , with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady went before the House Banking Committee this week to talk about the need for up to $50 billion more to finance the S&amp;L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on the administration 's handling of the S&amp;L crisis . The critics were Democrats , among them Congressman Bruce Vento of Minnesota , who chairs a special task force on the bailout . From the ABC News bureau in Washington , Congressman Vento joins me and my colleague , business editor Stephen Aug . Congressman Vento , the RTC is not working . Why ? Rep. BRUCE VENTO , ( D ) , Minnesota : Well , the RTC is floundering , frankly . They 're not accomplishing what they have to do , they 're not selling the assets . They 're hesitating . We 're out doing a high-wire act , and frankly , we 're not getting the concentration that 's necessary . The appointments have n't been made to the oversight board in a timely manner . We 've had three different presidents of the oversight board . There is infighting in the administration , an unwillingness to face up to the problems that exist . Frankly , he- the treasury secretary complained about a failing real estate market , but this is a year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these institutions have been sitting there static in the FDIC , RTC for 16 months . It 's become a junkyard of S&amp;Ls . Frankly , what could have been sold as year-old Chevrolets are being turned into junk . STEPHEN AUG , ABC News : Congressman , before we get to talk about one other subject , I want to clarify one matter . There 's been a lot of talk about preventing this again by lowering the insurance limit on deposits . To what extent is there a growing consensus among Democrats that that ought to be done ? Rep. VENTO : I think there 's concern about that , in terms of undermining the ability of any of the financial institutions to still find a safe place to save . Who are we going to hurt if we do that ? The fact is , you 've got 110 million savers in the S&amp;Ls . The way to save the S&amp;Ls is not by hurting the people that have savings in financial institutions . I think that clearly the problem here was not one of the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of S&amp;Ls ; those were powers that banks had had for years . It 's a failure of regulation and of courage . So we put in place some new requirements , a 1,000-page bill last year that gave the administration all the dollars that they asked for , gave them all the powers and the structure that they wanted , plus , of course , a lot of other things that we thought were important @!AUG Yeah , but briefly , are you likely to press for lower insurance limits than the $100,000 ? Rep. VENTO : Oh , you know , I think we can look at that in terms of risk-sharing , but I think we want to be very careful so that we do n't undermine the basic confidence that the American people have that their savings are insured . That 's what this is all about , after all . I 'm not- we 're supposed to be protecting the deposits . Today , we have , for instance , foreign deposits which are uninsured which are being covered . We have banks that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $100,000 , your savings are protected . So I think there are a lot of other problems here that need to be addressed . You have the FDIC , including all sorts of exotic types of investments , into the insurance scheme . There are other ways to approach this than that , but I am certainly willing to look at that in terms of limiting liability . But there 's no effort to do that . In Continental Illinois , for many other institutions , we could cut the insurance off at some point . The basic question comes back , Stephen and Sander , is , what is the effect on the economy ? In Europe , there is no deposit insurance , but yet we do n't see the banks failing , because the effect would be , of course , catastrophic on their economies @!VANOCUR Look , Congressman , Congress has the responsibility , you drew up the legislation , you 've got an oversight function . Is there any way Congress can crack the whip over the administration to get the kind of satisfaction I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well , I agree with you . I think that there 's a volcano of public opinion abuilding against the actions and the way that the RTC is moving into or not moving into eliminating the assets , and the growing cost of this particular problem . The fact is that we are trying to do that . We have to obviously be temperate and work with the administration , and that 's what we 're trying to do . We have been , of course , trying to point out some of the practices that are not working . We 've tried to be reasonable . We 've tried to give them the tools . If they need additional tools , we want to work with them , but we ca n't basically administer the law . That 's the job of the Reagan administration and the Bush administration today @!VANOCUR Thank you very much , Congressman . Thanks for joining us here on Business World . Rep. VENTO : You 're welcome @!VANOCUR When we come back , one industry 's efforts to clear the air of dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference opens in London on Wednesday . The White House announced this week that it would support a new international fund to help poor countries phase out chemicals that damage the ozone layer , which protects us from the sun 's harmful rays . In this country , industries which have been part of the problem are working to become part of the solution . voice-over When University of California scientists measure the ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons in air samples from around the world , they routinely find high concentrations in Silicon Valley . One major culprit : cleaning solvents commonly used by the electronics industry . Prof. F. SHERWOOD ROWLAND , University of California : Public opinion polls show that 85 percent of the people knew that CFCs caused ozone depletion , but the electronics industry was apparently in the other 15 percent . They did n't seem to know that they were part of the problem @!VANOCUR voice-over Shortly after Rowland first reported on CFCs 16 years ago , they were phased out of U.S. aerosols , but they remained in solvents . As the electronics industry expanded , so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.25 million pounds in the last three years . JUNE ANDERSON , Environmental Manager , IBM : They 're almost non-toxic , they 're nonflammable , they 're non-explosive , and they were highly effective for cleaning and drying the parts @!VANOCUR voice-over Nevertheless , IBM joined a growing list of major corporations that recently announced plans to totally eliminate CFCs over the next few years . And this spring , it unveiled its substitute , a sort of elaborate dishwasher using water-based detergents . Ms. ANDERSON : There was a large investment in development and engineering , and then a large initial capital investment , but over the long run , there will be a payback in aqueous cleaning @!VANOCUR voice-over The AT&amp;T alternatives include terpines , organic citrus derivatives . Dupont , a major supplier of CFCs , says it will cease production by the year 2000 , not soon enough for Greenpeace activists , who attempted to hamper the current output by blocking trains . DuPont is one of many companies with chemical alternatives in the works , a trend that 's causing some alarm . KATY WOLF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another mistake , as we have in the past , moving from one chemical substance to another , without trying to figure out what the consequences of adopting these substances are before we precipitously adopt them @!VANOCUR voice-over And rapid change can be especially tough on small businesses , as restrictions tighten . TONY COLLAZZO , Director of Quality , Vantronics : Our machine life right now , as we see it , is less than two years . Payback , of course , is not there . We 're looking at other machines in the near future to replace the equipment that we purchased only several months ago @!VANOCUR voice-over Surprisingly , the best solution might be no solution . This component maker says 70 percent of its products are cleaned for customer-demanded cosmetic appearances . Mr. COLLAZZO : The life of most of the products that we 're talking about in our environment , that we call high-tech , is usually only five to 10 years . In that type of environment , there 's no necessity to have the cleanliness level that we 're talking about @!VANOCUR voice-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that the cleaning step is eliminated altogether . But this no-clean method is not appropriate for all products . DAVID CHITTICK , Vice President Environmental Safety , AT&amp;T : We know how to get so far , but we do n't know precisely how we 're going to get all of the processes free of CFCs yet . It 'll require some technological breakthroughs @!VANOCUR voice-over Some products must adhere to military specifications that demand CFC use . While the Pentagon claims they \" will be revised to allow for suitable alternatives , \" the industry counters : \" Service directives to consider CFC alternatives appear to be having negligible impact on DOD officials , the procurement officers who buy our products . \" The pressure to change is mounting . The 1987 international agreement calling for 50 percent emissions reduction by 1998 will be modified in London next week . It 's expected to be toughened . The Clean Air Bill that passed the Senate in April calls for total elimination by the year 2000 , and may restrict industry even more . Sen. JOHN CHAFEE , ( R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they leapt up and down cheering when we were working on this , and did it in committee , but they 've been very responsible @!VANOCUR voice-over But , can industry commitment really make a difference ? Prof. ROWLAND : As soon as they switch over , yes , it has a very positive effect , and in fact , that these large companies have found apparently good solutions so quickly says that finding alternatives was n't a really difficult problem , it 's just was- you had to start to look @!VANOCUR In a minute , tracking the railroad industry two decades after a giant railroad bankruptcy . Commercial break VANOCUR : Twenty years ago this week , a giant railroad , the Penn Central , declared bankruptcy . As Stephen Aug reports , it was the beginning of a hopeful new chapter for the railroad business , as well as the end of a glorious old chapter @!AUG voice-over Back in the 1940s , the old Pennsylvania Railroad was run with such precision , it was often considered the standard railroad of the world . But by the 1960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply cut into its business . A merger with the rival New York Central in 1968 failed to revive the two companies . Two years later , they plunged into what was then the biggest bankruptcy in American history . In the government , there were genuine fears about what would happen if the Penn Central actually shut down . Former Senator Vance Hartke , ( D ) , Indiana : 1970 There would be a shortage of sufficient coal to keep the utilities going , so you 'd have blackouts , you 'd have no heat , you 'd have actual shortages of food and the rest of the United States would come toppling down and you 'd have a depression bigger than the depression of the 1930s @!AUG voice- over Robert Blanchette was one of the trustees who ran the Penn Central in bankruptcy . Now a Washington transportation lawyer , Blanchette blames Interstate Commerce Commission delay for the failure . ROBERT BLANCHETTE , former Penn Central Trustee : It took the ICC six years to get the approval to merge the Penn and the Central , longer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!AUG voice-over But the government kept the bankrupt railroad running , mainly through hundreds of millions of dollars of subsidies . By the mid- ' 70s , it was literally falling apart . Mr. BLANCHETTE : Good management could n't help it and bad management could n't hurt it . It was- the railroad was not operated , it was observed . And because there was nothing- you could n't turn left , you could n't turn right , you could n't do anything , you had to go to the ICC , you had to go to the Congress , you had to go to the government . And all you could do was watch it @!AUG voice-over In 1976 , the government combined Penn Central with several smaller bankrupt railroads and created Conrail as a vast government-owned freight railroad in the Northeast and Midwest . Total cost to the taxpayers : about $7 billion . But Congress decided that if the railroads were to survive , they 'd have to be deregulated . To the railroads , that meant learning to compete . ANTHONY HATCH , Analyst , Paine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor numbers come down from a high of about just 500,000 workers at the beginning of the 1980s down to about 230,000 right now . That 's been forced on them by the marketplace . They are becoming market-sensitive . They are slowly - dragging their heels and kicking and screaming - but becoming price-sensitive . They are becoming less like armies and more like companies @!AUG voice-over Deregulation has given the railroads freedom to price most of their services as they wish , and made it easier to abandon or sell unprofitable branch lines . And that 's created a lot of new smaller regional railroads , like the Iowa Interstate . PAUL BANNER , CEO , Iowa Interstate Railroad : As a new railroad , under the deregulation , we could buy the railroad , get Interstate Commerce approval in less than a month @!AUG voice-over Iowa Interstate uses the latest rail technology , the same as the bigger railroads , like this loader that stacks 40-foot containers . This container is carrying goods made in Chicago and bound for Korea . Banner says on long hauls he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck has to go from the West Coast to Chicago . That 's a distance of roughly 2,500 miles . He 's not competitive on the long haul , whereas we , with one engine pulling all these containers , can be very competitive @!AUG voice-over But it 's the trucks , especially like these triple trailers , that have some railroad executives worried about the future , like James Hagen , who runs Conrail . JAMES HAGEN , CEO , Conrail : I think it 's a significant danger that you could probably lose 15 to 20 percent of your current freight , and better than half of your profitability if they were allowed to run nationwide @!AUG voice-over Hagen was head of the government agency that created Conrail , so he helped plan the system he 's now running . Hagen says it turned out about as expected , but he has some questions about the future of the railroad industry in general . Mr. HAGEN : Use a yellow light . I guess I would say that it 's not going to boom , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can compete @!AUG I began covering the Penn Central story in 1966 . It turned out to be an unusually long story , but the end finally came in 1987 , when the government sold its Conrail stock to the public . The result ? The Penn Central bankruptcy encouraged deregulation , which turned around the entire industry . Sandy @!VANOCUR Thanks , Steve . When we come back , idea-sharing helps some high-tech executives get their businesses into high gear . Commercial break VANOCUR : Turning to the week on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell the Dow Jones Industrial average finished the week up 73.5 points , just beating its previous all-time high . Last week , our panel of stock market experts from around the country predicted an up week . For the week ahead , our panel is split . For the long term , panelist Elaine Garzarelli , a market strategist with Shearson Lehman Hutton , is optimistic . ELAINE GARZARELLI , Market Strategist : Well , I think over the next nine to 12 months the stock market should be in a rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly better than the blue chips , the S&amp;P and the Dow . Where in the Dow Jones and S&amp;P you could probably get a return of 15 to 20 percent in an index fund , but if you buy small stocks , the return could be 20 to 25 percent . So I think the next nine to 12 months , you should be 100 percent invested in the stock market , and at that point we 'll have to see where we are , because if everybody becomes bullish in 12 months , then that 'll be the time to sell @!VANOCUR In business , the cutting edge can be a two-edged sword , especially if your products and ideas are so new that the traditional business community has trouble understanding them and their potential . When that happens , one way out of your bind might be to turn to past pioneers who do speak your language . CRAIG HILL , Chairman , Cortex Corporation : Each time we would double , it would put a great strain on our systems and procedures , it would cause people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great strain on our cash @!VANOCUR voice-over When Craig Hill , chairman of Cortex , the software maker near Boston that designs software to make other software , found his company was expanding beyond its ability its cope , he needed help , and found it at a group which might almost be called Entrepreneurs Anonymous . But its formal title is the Technology Executives Roundtable . Mr. HILL : And they were a group of entrepreneurs who had gathered together under DEC 's guidance , and we just shared problems and gave away- let 's say , shared secrets with one another @!VANOCUR voice-over With help from his friends at the Roundtable , Hill was able to keep his creditors satisfied and put the company on track to a more stable cash flow . The Cortex story is fairly typical of the Roundtable . Started by the folks at computermaker Digital Equipment Corporation as a means of growing their own industry . JOAN JACOBS , Manager , Technology Executives Roundtable : Early on , they really found that these emerging companies play a very important role in both the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success Digital sees as a vendor . And we 've established probably over 2,000 business relationships with partners and resellers , OEMs and independent software developers @!VANOCUR voice- over Each of the eight Roundtables across the country meets once a month . And each meeting , like this one in Dallas , provides time for executives to network as well as to focus on a particular topic , often money . STEVE CALL , Partner , TA Associates : If those firms were looking for financing because they 're growing very rapidly and doing very well , that 's an easy decision for firms like ourselves to make . If they 're looking for help because they 're running into some problems , it 's easier for them to raise money if they solve those problems first . And I think that 's the contribution that TER can make to those processes @!VANOCUR voice-over But TER 's managers and participants stress that finance is only one problem area . Often it 's personnel , operations and managing . ROBERT WEISMAN , Manager , Technology Executives Roundtable : Really , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide that type of feedback are people who have been there and done it . And you find , when you talk to entrepreneurs , that they have very large egos , and that they really- they do n't like people to tell them how to do things @!VANOCUR In a minute , business the old-fashioned way : one family 's success story . Commercial break VANOCUR : Getting a family business off the ground is n't easy , and neither is nurturing it , keeping it growing through three generations . That 's why the story of a store called Barneys New York is a fitting one for this Father 's Day . voice-over It 's opulent , upscale and one of the most successful family businesses today , but it had humble beginnings back in 1923 when Barney Pressman opened a men 's discount clothing store . FRED PRESSMAN , President , Barneys New York : Wooden floors and very simple chairs , small store , crowded with lots of suits , big signs all over the store , my father 's picture @!VANOCUR voice-over Barney 's son 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guidance , it was upgraded in image and size . Today , there 's a variety of merchandise and $130 million in gross revenues . And Fred 's sons are at the helm , while five Pressman women are in the company . Mr. PRESSMAN : We do n't have to have board meetings and we do n't have to get the okay from the banks . We can make decisions next to a clothing rack , or in a cafe over a cup of coffee . GENE PRESSMAN , Executive Vice President , Barneys New York : The key to working with your family is that everybody has to do something different . If there 's a tremendous amount of overlap , there can be conflicts @!VANOCUR voice- over So while Bob takes care of finances , Gene 's in charge of marketing , keeping up the creative spirit of bygone ads like this one from the ' 60s . The current campaign is too stylish to include the merchandise . And there are new ventures , notably satellite stores financed in part by a Japanese firm . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice President , Barneys New York : We were together with our friends and partners last March in Hawaii , and I had to go on the golf course because they love golf , and they complimented me for a course record of 120 in nine holes @!VANOCUR voice-over The Pressmans insist that service , like personal shoppers and in-office fittings for business executives , keeps customers happy , even if things can be a little pricey . Barney still keeps a watchful eye from Florida , but what about the future ? Well , Gene has a 14-month-old son who's- Mr. GENE PRESSMAN : Always going around touching fabric , and he 's always like rubbing his lips on my wife 's dress , you know , making cooing kind of- making noises , so- that makes me a little nervous , that he 's getting into it that early @!VANOCUR That 's it for this week .

Now , from New York , here 's Stephen Aug @!AUG The tremors from the savings and loan crisis continue to shake the banking industry from one end of the country to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell the 6,000-acre Stoneridge Ranch to a Japanese industrialist for $61 million , a loss of $270 million which U.S. taxpayers will have to swallow . In Washington , the S&amp;L crisis has become a political hot potato , and President Bush was feeling the heat when he told Justice Department officials to go after anyone responsible for S&amp;L fraud . President BUSH : We will not rest until the cheats and the chislers and the charlatans spend a large chunk of their lives behind the bars of a federal prison @!AUG The House Banking Committee went to Houston , where it heard Texas Treasurer Ann Richards say dumping real estate from failed savings and loans is disastrous for the Texas economy . But bad bank loans are n't just a phenomenon in Texas , and their effects are being felt far beyond the Lone Star State . voice over At Hingham , Massachusetts , work has slowed considerably on converting this old seminary into housing for senior citizens . That 's because the local bankers are unwilling to lend Frank Romano $92 million to complete the project . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no question trying to obtain credit today versus a year or two years ago , it 's like day and night . The criteria is different , and on a level of difficulty , let 's say one to 10 , 10 being the highest , we 're clearly at a 10 @!AUG voice over In fact , Romano is not alone . Banks all over New England have been cutting their lending sharply . During the first quarter of this year , lending by large New England banks was down 3.7 percent from the fourth quarter of last year . The second quarter is going to be down seven percent , and by the end of this year , lending may be down 14 percent from a year ago . But it 's not just New England . At the Brenner Paper Products company in the Queens section of New York City , they 've managed to add one new piece of equipment each year to keep up with technology . But all of a sudden , their banker is tougher to deal with . RHODA BRENNER-LEVENSON , President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the loan , and we did not purchase that particular piece of machinery , it just handicaps us in remaining competitive in manufacturing in this industry @!AUG voice over The so-called credit crunch is hitting small and mid-sized business firms across the country . A recent survey by the Federal Reserve has identified credit problems in the New York-New Jersey area , the Fed 's Cleveland district , the San Francisco district , and for the first time , credit problems in the St. Louis district and the Richmond , Virginia , district . ARTHUR LEVITT , CEO , Levitt Communications : I think the United States is in the midst of one of the most severe credit crunches that it has experienced in recent years because the regulatory environment has become so punishing @!AUG voice over The punishment began with the massive failures of savings and loans in Texas , and federal regulators are determined that will not happen again . So bankers as far away as Burlington , Vermont , are experiencing the fallout . JOSEPH BOUTIN , CEO , Howard Bank : Actually , the same examiners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as hardened examiners , they 've been through the battleground and they 're seasoned examiners ; they 're looking at credits differently than they did last year @!AUG voice over Like low-rent housing projects . Historically , these projects do not generate enough cash flow from rental income to service their debt . They rely on wealthy investors who put money into them as tax shelters . Mr. BOUTIN : It 's going to be tougher and tougher to fund affordable housing from a developmental standpoint , because a company has got to come up and show a game plan where the project is going to generate enough cash flow to service the debt @!AUG voice over Ed Furash , a banking consultant , has just come back from eight weeks visiting clients all over the country . EDWARD FURASH , Banking Consultant : What 's changed is the vigor and the attitude with which regulators are addressing the problem . It 's very clear that even though they may believe that the rules have n't changed , in many subtle ways , where they 're inside a bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been tougher in their loans @!AUG voice over That new , tough attitude is generating complaints on Capitol Hill . Rep. JOSEPH KENNEDY , ( D ) Massachusetts : Northeast banks have been treated more harshly than others . When the Southwest 's economy bottomed out a few years ago , regulators were n't nearly as harsh on lenders , even though Texas , in 1986 , was in far worse shape than New England is today . Rep. JOHN LaFALCE , ( D ) New York : Credit is more difficult to come by , and whenever you have credit that 's difficult to come by , you 're going to have a squeeze on economic growth , you 're going to have a squeeze on the ability to expand your business opportunities @!AUG voice over During Senate Banking Committee hearings last week , regulators defended their actions , pointing out that bank examiners consider local market conditions . ALAN GREENSPAN , Chairman , Federal Reserve Board : Our standards in these areas have not been tightened , though they may , because of deteriorating conditions in certain markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this should prove to be a positive force for the economy , by preserving the health of our commercial banking system @!AUG voice over What has bankers worried is that examiners are forcing them to mark loans down to their market value , even if the payments are up to date , basing their views on the possibility of a softer economy . Mr. FURASH : What 's going on is essentially that the regulators are looking at loans and painting a worst-case scenario for many of these loans . What would happen if the world came to an end ? Could you collect this loan ? Mr. BOUTIN : There is a move afoot to look at continuing to mark the market your loan portfolios , which would have a tremendous and devastating impact on bank profitability , it would fluctuate up and down based on those write-downs @!AUG The big worry here is that if the bank examiners are too tough on the bankers for too long , that will set off a chain reaction . Regulators force bankers to write down their loans , each write-down pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cautious . That starves business of money . Business firms cut back or fail , and before you know it , we are in a recession . In just a minute , the man who is supposed to know where the money goes , Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke . Commercial break AUG : This week 's Business World guest wears several regulatory hats , any of which may be enough of a burden for any one person . As Comptroller of the Currency , he has oversight for national banks . He also sits on the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . And he 's a member of the board of the Resolution Trust Corporation , which runs the S&amp;L bailout . Robert Clarke joins us from ABC affiliate KTRK in Houston . How are you , Mr. Clarke ? Nice of you to be here . ROBERT CLARKE , Comptroller of the Currency : Fine , Steve . Thank you @!AUG A lot of bankers and a lot of small and mid-sized businessmen are saying that examiners are getting so tough that the bankers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your examiners are saying they 've got to learn how to just say no . That 's causing real problems . What are you telling these examiners ? Mr. CLARKE : Steve , we 're simply telling examiners that you have to do your job in a professional manner , call the shots as you see them and be attentive to what 's really happening in the marketplace , where the bank is located that you 're examining . We 're not telling them anything more than that @!AUG Then why are the bankers and the businessmen getting a different idea ? They say that loans they routinely would get , they 're simply not getting any more . Mr. CLARKE : Well , the borrowers are saying that , and I think in part it 's a recognition of the fact that in some parts of our country , unfortunately , the economies have softened . Lenders are tightening their standards and the demand for loans is down @!AUG Well , you see problems , I guess , certainly in Texas and in Florida , but now the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cleveland district , the Richmond district , the New York-New Jersey area . It seems to be spreading , and sooner or later , some people say , it 's going to spread itself into a recession . Is that the likely outcome of all of this ? Mr. CLARKE : Steve , we certainly do n't think that it 's going to spread into a recession . I think that what has happened is that in many parts of the country the real estate market has been overdone . There 's been too much real estate built in relation to the demand , and there 's going to be an inevitable correction @!AUG Well , let 's ignore real estate for a minute . Many of these people are in businesses that have nothing to do with real estate . We talked to a person who makes paper products . Somebody else runs a health club , routinely gets a loan to carry him over the summer . Normal businesses are simply not getting money . Why are the bankers so reluctant to lend in situations like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have themselves about weakening in some of these markets . I think the efforts that our examiners have made to try to bring about a sense of reality on the part of bankers has caused bankers to look more carefully at how they lend money , with more emphasis on getting paid back , and that inevitably it 's going to cause some constriction in the availability of credit @!AUG Is this good ? Mr. CLARKE : I think it is definitely good to have bankers concentrating on the fundimentals of good lending policies . We 've seen what can happen when bankers do n't do that , with the savings and loan problem . We 've gone through a period of the 80s where there 's been a lot of credit granted to a lot of people , and I think the taxpayers in this country who are now being asked to pay a substantial part of the cost of some of that are expecting us to be doing our jobs @!AUG Let 's get briefly over the savings and loans . Incidentally , the $100,000 insurance money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. CLARKE : I do n't think the amount of the insurance is the real problem , Steve . I think the problem is , what do you do with your insured deposits ? and I think in many cases the insured deposits were not prudently invested in good loans or in other types of investments @!AUG Do you think the insurance limit ought to be lowered in view of the expense that it 's caused in the S&amp;L problem ? Mr. CLARKE : It 's certainly one of the options that has been suggested . It seems to me , though , that the size of the insured deposits is not the problem , it 's what you do with the deposits once you get them @!AUG Well , thank you very much for being with us on Business World today . When we come back , in Germany , they 're getting set on their mark @!ANNOUNCER The multi-billion dollar savings and loan bailout represents only a portion of the programs guaranteed by the government . Uncle Sam 's liabilities for bank deposits total $2.9 trillion . Insurance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trillion . Government-backed home mortgages add another $760 billion , while FHA and VA housing loans , student and small business loans account for $590 billion . Add just over $200 billion for agriculture and other direct loans , and that brings the grand total to almost $5.8 trillion of taxpayer liabilities . Commercial break AUG : Turning to the week on Wall Street , just before Friday 's closing bell , the Dow Jones Industrial average took a last-minute nosedive to finish the week down by almost 79 points . Last week , our stock market panel of experts from around the country were split ; our panel 's consensus is for a down week ahead . Some of our panelists feel the rally which started eight weeks ago is due for a pause or a correction . Panelist Robert Farrell , a technical analyst at Merrill Lynch , does not foresee a long bull rally . ROBERT FARRELL , Technical Analyst : Well , right now , we 're at a fairly important juncture because we 're at the end of a quarter and we 've had a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be the best rise of the year . My expectation is that there is still some more money to come into stocks going into the summer , so I think we will see still some higher highs between now and maybe mid summer . But in the overall scheme of things , I think we 're in the late stages of a market cycle , not at the beginning of a long bull market @!AUG Eastern Europe 's first regulated stock exchange opened this past week in the Baroque Budapest Bank Building , the computers amid the marble columns and brass chandeliers . Although Hungary did have some false starts in securities trading over the past seven years , this new stock market is working with American-style regulation . The economic democratization of Eastern Europe will take a major step forward in just another week , when the two Germanys begin using a single currency . As ABC News correspodent Jerry King reports , it 's a process viewed with both anticipation and some trepidation . JERRY KING , ABC News : voice over Just a year ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a way , the little car , with its plastic body and the engine of a motorcycle , may still be a symbol . People used to wait 15 years for the chance to buy one ; now you could hardly give one away . Nobody wants East Germany 's currency , either . That disappears with next weekend 's monetary union that many believe will be the de facto unification of Germany . That 's when the ost mark is replaced by the powerful , West German Deutsch mark . Several East German businesses have already jumped the gun on currency union . For weeks now , they 've been selling Western goods with prices listed in both currencies . East Germans have waited 40 years to get their hands on real money , so what 's a few more hours outside a bank , if it means converting their savings into Deutsch marks . There is a lot of bureaucracy , of course . Every East German has to set up a special account to facilitate the changeover . Under the two-tier system , the first 4,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's roughly the equivalent of $2,400 . Anything above that amount gets converted at two-to-one , 50 percent less . Then their own East marks will be officially worthless . So what about pocket money ? Again , there will be more standing in line , this time to make withdrawals . Many economists fear monetary union will produce a buy-it-while-you-can national spending splurge that will fuel inflation . But East Germans we 've talked to say they 'll be conservative . 1st EAST GERMAN : through interpreter We wo n't spend it . We want to save it like we always did . 2nd EAST GERMAN : through interpreter We are going to be careful with the money . We have to be careful with it . 3rd EAST GERMAN : through interpreter First , I will save my money and then I will buy a vacation , maybe Spain and then America , which is where I 'd love to go @!KING voice over Many are worried where they 'll end up is on an unemployment line . There are dire predictions of up to two million unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists predict that by year 's end , on average , East Germans will have suffered a 10 percent cut in real wages , and they forecast bankruptcy for many small and medium-sized businesses unable to compete in a free market . on camera But most East Germans realize their economy is a shambles already , and there 's nowhere to go but up . And when they look up at their rich capitalist neighbors , unification looks like a pretty good idea . Jerry King , ABC News , Berlin @!AUG When we return , the thrill of victory , the agony of defeat , and a little alchemy as two entrepreneurs try turning iron into gold . Commercial break AUG : It 's a rare sporting event where amateurs can successfuly run nose-to-nose with the pros . But the triathlon is still relatively new and now as established as , say , marathons , one element of the triathlon . As Sander Vanocur reports , that means opportunities abound for both athletes and entrepreneurs to test their metal . SANDER VANOCUR : voice over The ultimate goal , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance test of all , consisting of a 2.4-mile ocean swim , 112-mile bike ride , and then a marathon , 26.1-mile run . DAVID VOTH , Co-Owner , Ironman Triathlon : If I could swim and bike and run those distances in that type of environment , I could basically accomplish anything @!VANOCUR voice over The challenge for nearly of 300,000 American triathletes , to split their time between a demanding training schedule and a career . Take Joe Russell , a 57-year-old construction project manager in Monterey , California , whose been competing for over seven years . JOE RUSSELL , Manager , Granite Construction : I think it 's a challenge , it 's a release , it 's a sense of achievement @!VANOCUR voice over Harriet Anderson , also 57 , divides her time between being a school nurse in suburban San Francisco and a competitive triathlete . HARRIETT ANDERSEN , Nurse , Redwood City , California , Schools : I think the Ironman has kind of a mystique that everyone wants to try it once , and I think you want to finish , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Crone . His wife got him started to help cope with the stress . A year ago , he opened a triathlete store franchise and has been juggling his schedule ever since . PETER CRONE , Owner , Fleet Feet , Palo Alto : I generally try to get up around , if possible , 5:30 or 6:00 and get a swim in and a run or a bike ride before I come here . By the time I get here to work , there 's a chance I 'm never going to get out again , so I need to do two sports in the morning @!VANOCUR voice over These weekend warriors , seemingly willing to sweat and strain limitlessly , earn among the highest incomes and are among the best educated of all recreational athletes . The median salary is above $60,000 and nearly 80 percent have college , and post- graduate degrees . TERRY DAVIS , Director , Wildflower Triathlon : This sport is really set up for a lot of professional people , a lot of executives and things like that , and this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they relax @!VANOCUR voice over You can sense their determination as they prepare for the race . It starts at 7:00 am and the temperature is already in the 80s . After the gun sounds , the smiles fade , and the serious business of competing takes over . Triathletes look for every advantage : wet suits designed for them cost around $300 . They could save as much as three minutes in the two-mile swim . But the bicycle is perhaps where technology can save the most and also cost the most . Mr. DAVIS : You can start with a Huffey or a Schwinn bicycle and the next thing you know you 're buying shoes and you 're buying helmets , and what you can do is you can even get up to bicycles now that are $4,000 and $5,000 and $8,000 @!VANOCUR voice over Harriett Anderson is relying on the same technology that helped Greg LeMon in his super-human effort to win last year 's Tour de France bicycle race to help her get to Hawaii again . She 's using the same pedals and shoes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance . Ms. ANDERSON : I love the new equipment on bikes . I 'd like to get even a better bike , and to go a little faster . Mr. CRONE : Triathletes are notorious for being yuppies that have a lot of money and no limit to what he 'll buy to improve your performance a smidgeon @!VANOCUR voice over Dr. Jim Gills and David Voth met while competing in triathlons , and recently bought the Ironman name and race for over $2 million . They get a royalty for each of the 800,000 Ironman watches sold world-wide last year , and retailing for $40 each . And both are looking to expand the Ironman , both overseas and here , by adding a new series to get a larger share of the $300 million U.S. triathlon market . DAVID VOTH , Co-Owner , Ironman Triathlon : We anticipate being able to pay off debt within 18 months to two years , but it has a lot to do , not with the fact of the race itself ; it has to do with other ancillary projects that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right back . Commercial break AUG : Next week much of the world 's attention will focus on Eastern Europe , where the Soviet Union begins private ownership of property , and where both Germanys begin using a single currency . We 'll be there , too , as Business World broadcasts from Berlin . That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Stephen Aug . On behalf of Sander Vanocur and everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223864 @!SANDER-VANOCUR : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice-over A rough ride for the airlines . Already squeezed for operating profits , the combination of higher oil prices and the lower economy could knock some carriers out of the skies . And Boeing . Will it still be flying high if the airlines get hurt by higher fuel costs ? From New York , this week 's Business World guest , Texaco Chief Executive Officer , James Kinnear . Also , this week , the world embargo against Iraq puts some American rice growers between Iraq and a hard place . And oil intelligence . Even a company that keeps track of oil trends can be caught off guard @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR Week two of the Persian Gulf crisis . A week in which oil prices began to stabilize . Although still high , oil was in a trading range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rising oil prices and a slowing economy forced corporate managers to take a close look at corporate travel budgets , and usually tighten them . After all , higher oil prices affect us , whether traveling in a four-cylinder car or four-engine jet . The few-cents-a-gallon hike , that may cost an extra couple of dollars at the pump , really adds up when your gas gauge measures gallons by the thousands . ROBERT CRANDALL , Chairman , American Airlines : Very rapid fuel price increases clearly presents some very grave problems . Every time fuel goes up one penny , it costs $25 million a year at American Airlines @!VANOCUR voice-over And it may be worse for carriers with older , gas-guzzling fleets , those already plagued by financial woes , like TWA . CARL ICAHN , Chairman , TWA : April 26th We are at a crossroad . And I agree that we should either grow larger now or shrink . And the real question is , what are our costs going to be . We can not afford the cost that the airline has . My job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleed to death @!VANOCUR voice-over And while several airlines do remain healthy , the overall industry is troubled . Last year , it had a first-quarter operating profit of over $190 million . This year saw a staggering $684-million loss . An aviation consulting firm that forecast a $400-$500 million operating profit for this year now projects a post-deregulation record billion-dollar loss . With rising labor costs , especially for pilots , weak domestic demand , the only bright spot is increased international travel . But that accounts for less than 20 percent of revenue . CANDACE BROWNING , Analyst , Wertheim Schroder : Domestic is still the real name of the game . You have to be doing well in domestic in order for the industry to be producing profits . So , it 's nice gravy that international is doing well , but it 's not a savior @!VANOCUR voice-over What might be are the fare increases most carriers have already announced . In fact , the industry trade group held a press conference to explain why they were so quick to act . ROBERT AARONSON , President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large fuel supplies on hand - typically no more than a day or so - the cost impact was immediate . Moreover , many airlines have already sold 30 to 40 percent of their seats for the next 60 days , at prices based on lower fuel costs @!VANOCUR voice- over Industry lobbyists are also fighting a bill passed by the House last week that would raise passenger taxes to improve airports . They say there is already $7 billion in the aviation trust fund that the government is using to help offset the deficit . But even if it 's killed and fares go up , it may be too late for the already-bankrupt Eastern , still suffering from labor disputes and charges of falsifying maintenance records . TIM PETTEE , Analyst , Merrill Lynch : The travel agent and the business traveler appear to be reluctant to put people on Eastern . And , as a result , the losses- since the airlines make money off the business traveler , the higher-fare traveler , Eastern 's just having a very difficult time establishing any presence in the marketplace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , retain the cash and liquidate @!VANOCUR voice-over Soaring jet fuel prices may eventually mean more expenses for business . Overnight shippers have not yet raised rates , since their fuel costs are only about four to eight percent of their operating expenses , as opposed to 15 percent for passenger airlines . But the delivery services may not be able to absorb further fuel price hikes . And more passengers may have to pay full fare . Mr. PETTEE : Discounting , on a nationwide basis , is probably a thing of the past . What the industry is resorting to and relying upon are more regional discounting efforts . For instance , right now on the West Coast , there 's a very , very aggressive fare war going on @!VANOCUR voice-over Will hard times lead to consolidation ? Just this week , SAS got control of Continental , and Frank Lorenzo departed from the airline scene . But that does n't necessarily represent a trend . Mr. CRANDALL : It 's very difficult to bring airlines together and treat employees equitably . And a consequence is we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And while many do expect consolidation , airlines can be resourceful when it comes to survival . Ms. BROWNING : Airlines throw off a lot of depreciation , hence they throw off a lot of cash . That 's why airlines are very hard to kill @!VANOCUR Later , we 'll look at how the airlines ' plight might affect number one aircraft builder , Boeing . But next , a view from one oil executive . Joining us here in New York , Texaco President James Kinnear . Commercial break VANOCUR : The tank tracks were still fresh in the Kuwaiti sands as one oil company after another began to raise prices , even for gasoline from oil that may have been purchased and refined months ago . The outcry at the pumps was heard all the way to Washington , where President Bush eventually asked the oil companies to hold the line . This week 's Business World guest heads one of the nation 's biggest oil companies . Texaco President and CEO James Kinnear joins us here in New York . Mr. Kinnear , we live in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once again , that the oil companies are - forgive me - screwing the American people . True or false ? JAMES KINNEAR , CEO , Texaco : Certainly it 's not true . I understand the feelings of the American public . I sympathize with them . And we at Texaco are and plan to be part of the solution , not part of the problem @!VANOCUR All right . It 's quite easy to beat up on oil companies . But how does the process work ? Do you set the prices ? Do the distributors set the prices ? Does the operator of the station set the prices ? Mr. KINNEAR : Well , there are about three elements in that question . First off , the United States imports some 50 percent of its crude and product . And those crudes and products are priced more or less on the date of delivery into the United States . Now we at Texaco , we purchase about 60 percent of what we provide to the public around the world . We sell to distributors . We sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own prices . Three-quarters of what Texaco sells in gasoline is sold by independent businessmen who set their own prices @!VANOCUR Do you have a corporate or a public relations problem in the oil industry ? Mr. KINNEAR : We think that we want to tell the American people just exactly what the facts are here , that certainly we at Texaco have been very responsive ; we have shown restraint . For an example , over the last six weeks , the price of the widely- traded crude in the United States , West Texas Intermediate , has gone up about $9 a barrel . Our selling price of regular gasoline to our re-sellers has gone up about $3 a barrel @!VANOCUR All right . Could a company like Texaco , which is no novice in Middle Eastern affairs , have seen this coming ? Mr. KINNEAR : It was very difficult to see this sort of a situation coming . This is unprecedented . Obviously , oil is volatile . We have many supply sources around the world . But a situation of this magnitude was not predictable @!VANOCUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening again ? What would it take , in the best of all possible worlds , over the next ten years , for Texaco to start pumping a lot of investment into wells in this country that have been capped , or start researching and refining and digging again , in the United States ? Mr. KINNEAR : Certainly we think that additional activity , particularly in the areas of secondary and tertiary recovery in the United States , are very good things to do . We believe that activity in Alaska will be good . We believe that activity in other producing basins around the world to diversify our sources of supply would be good . We couple that with research in the use of coal . We couple that in research in conservation @!VANOCUR All right . Are you for resurrecting that once- dreaded phrase , the oil depletion allowance ? Would that be an inducement to dig , drill , domestically ? Mr. KINNEAR : I would n't call it the oil depletion allowance . I think there are some changes in the tax act that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world @!VANOCUR Is there any way this country can be domestically self- sufficient ? Mr. KINNEAR : It is unlikely that we will be self-sufficient in oil . But I do believe that we can diversify our sources from all around the world . I think we can use more coal in the United States . And obviously , I do support conservation @!VANOCUR Is Texaco now in a process of reviewing , maybe shifting its emphasis on Middle East oil to other sources of supply : Venezuela , Mexico , the United States ? Mr. KINNEAR : We have to recognize that some 75 percent of the world 's oil is found in the Middle East . That will be a very , very important source of oil for the world for the foreseeable future . However , in addition , we are , in fact , looking in the other , unexplored basins around the world @!VANOCUR A final question : Who 's a bigger threat to Texaco ? Saddam Hussein or Carl Icahn ? Mr. KINNEAR : I think that Texaco has been able to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we 're just here today being part of the solution , as opposed to being part of the problem @!VANOCUR Thank you very much . Thanks for joining us here on Business World . And when we come back , the embargo against Iraq leaves some U.S. farmers with a harvest of more pain than grain . Commercial break VANOCUR : Turning to the week on Wall Street . At Friday 's closing bell , the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down for the week by more than 93 points , even worse than the previous week 's 89-point drop . Our panel of stock market experts from around the country had predicted an up-week . For the week ahead , our panel is split , saying the market 's behavior will depend directly on what happens in the Middle East . Panelist Al Frank , a Santa Monica-based newsletter publisher says if you have n't bailed out of the market , you might as well stay there . AL FRANK , Investment Advisor : We think it 's a little late to sell . And it may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy . And we look forward to the market rallying later this year , and meeting our expectations of 3200 on the Dow @!VANOCUR This weekend marks the end of a dream for Canadian financier Robert Campeau , the creator of a real estate and retailing empire that became synonymous with junk bonds has been ousted as head of the Canadian holding company which bears his name . Directors of the company , which owns what were once the Federated and Allied store chains , announced , after the market closed Friday , that Campeau was not reappointed as chairman and chief executive . Campeau had already lost control of the retailing empire when it filed for bankruptcy . President Bush is betting that if an embargo against Iraq effectively cuts off that nation 's food supply , then Iraq might lose its appetite for conquest and quit Kuwait . While public opinion polls say roughly three-quarters of Americans support the president 's actions so far , there are some U.S. farmers who might not be applauding . JIM CARDIFF , Rice Farmer : We may lose about 25 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped out right now . Did n't have much market to begin with , the way I look at it . It seems like every time something comes up , they want to use food for a tool @!VANOCUR voice-over For Texas rice grower Jim Cardiff , this is a grim harvest season . Even though most of the world has said it wo n't ship food to Iraq , he 's not happy about the loss of market . And , unlike the rest of the world , U.S. farmers already knew their market in Iraq would shrink . MARK CREED , Rice Broker : This is something that we 've known , really since about May . The U.S. rice industry reconciled itself to the fact that Iraq was not going to receive the credit , and consequently we could n't count on them as a buyer this season @!VANOCUR voice-over The loss of the Iraqi market will also hit U.S. rice millers and shippers , who , in recent years , were accustomed to supply much of Iraq 's imported rice , largely sold under a U.S. government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May . The exports to Iraq comprised almost a quarter of U.S. rice exports , an eighth of the U.S. rice crop . The embargo on shipments to Iraq could n't come at a worse time for American rice farmers . Production has been high ; prices way down . And with a loss of a 400,000-ton rice market , the outlook is grim . Mr. CARDIFF : It sure is going to be off from what it was last year , which was off already , you know . We 're just hanging on because it 's in our blood , I guess @!VANOCUR When we return , where do you turn for oil intelligence ? To an oil oracle ? Or maybe a slick operator . Commercial break VANOCUR : The price of crude oil finished the week at just over $26 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate . That 's down about $2 since the start of the week , but still up more than 50 percent since early last month . How do you find out what 's going on in the oil industry ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the oil companies got a sobering briefing from the director of the CIA . But if you were n't invited , you could turn to a company where size is not necessarily the measure of savvy. voice-over About half of the oil traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange is by companies that rely , at least in part , on advice purchased from Energy Security Analysis . FOSTER MELLEN , Energy Security Analysis : We provide information and analysis , related to the politics and the economics that affect oil markets . A large part of our service is the providing of just basic information on oil supply and demand stock levels @!VANOCUR voice-over So , where do they get their information ? Employees in Washington and London call all over the world to gather oil statistics which they analyze . The group 's most important publication describes European oil stockpiles , and is distributed via fax . ESA 's 250 clients vary from big oil companies like Exxon and Mobil to small drillers and refiners to foreign oil ministries , even OPEC , clients who pay from $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah , and I think it makes- You know , the next 48 hours might be fairly critical @!VANOCUR voice- over But , despite its renowned reputation , the crisis caught ESA off guard . Its founder went off to a secluded honeymoon and was first heard from via fax on Thursday , a week after the invasion . Mr. MELLEN : The quote that Hosni Mubarak used yesterday , \" Hoped that August would be a quiet month , \" was almost the exact same words that Ed Krapels left us with . It 's certainly turned out to be anything but quiet @!VANOCUR voice-over So , amid price gyrations and questions about crude oil production and supply , what is ESA telling its clients about the future ? Mr. MELLEN : There continues to be substantial up-side price risk . $35 , $40 prices are within reason , under certain scenarios . But basically , we 're telling them that we 're seeing prices , over the near term through the end of the year , in the $25 to $30 range @!VANOCUR In just a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commercial break VANOCUR : The crisis in the Persian Gulf , with its impact on oil prices and stocks , poses problems for airlines and the travel industry and also holds some potential hazards for aircraft makers . Commercial aircraft are the biggest U.S. industrial export , and Boeing the biggest maker . Boeing is such a dominant factor that , this past Autumn , a strike at Boeing sent the stock market down . And the down turn and its output forced U.S. trade numbers down , as well . voice-over The last time the economy got hit with a double whammy of an oil shock and a recession , back in the early 70s , Boeing was almost knocked out of the skies . The work force nosedived from 100,000 down to 40,000 . But Boeing says , this time , things are different , with workers making planes around the clock , trying to fill $78 billion worth of back orders . JOHN HAYHURST , Vice Pres. , Marketing , Boeing : If the high oil prices are of short-term duration , I think it will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long period of time , it could reduce the- over the long term , reduce the demand for jetliners @!VANOCUR voice-over Outside of Boeing , some experts say that with the prolonged recession and higher oil prices , even that firm 's $78 billion back-log itself may be the one in the economy . JORDAN GREENE , Analyst , Avmark Services : Boeing is not going to hold any customers ' feet to the fire and lose a customer in the future to a competitor @!VANOCUR voice-over But Boeing says the positive factors far outweigh the negatives . The most important is the continued growth in worldwide air travel . While the rate of growth has dipped twice during the last two recessions , it has , nevertheless , remained positive . New orders , in the meantime , have surged in a continuous upward trend over the past decade , to a record $120 billion . And there 's a new bullish factor . Aging aircraft will soon have to be replaced . PAUL NISBET , Senior Analyst , Prudential Bache : We 've never really replaced aircraft in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a feeling that about 3,000 of those will be scrapped in the next 10 years @!VANOCUR voice-over Because of a bulge in the deliveries of new jets in the late 1960s , a large number of old aircraft will be reaching retirement age in the next couple of years . And a third factor boosting demand for new planes , they 're more fuel efficient . So higher fuel prices may lead to early retirement of older fuel guzzlers . PETER MUSSER , Analyst , Ragen MacKenzie : You get between 10 and 30 percent less fuel consumption @!VANOCUR voice-over But what if some of the weaker airlines were dragged down by higher fuel prices and a worldwide recession ? Would n't Boeing feel the ripple effect ? Mr. NISBET : The orders will stay pretty much the same , simply because the airlines in question that might be forced out of business , are ones that do not have , for the main , any orders for new aircraft @!VANOCUR voice-over Boeing even plans to launch a brand new wide body to an engine jet , the 777 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. HAYHURST : We have every expectation that we will be successful in launching the airplane by December 31st @!VANOCUR voice-over While Airbus and McDonnell Douglas , with its new MD-11 , are ahead of Boeing in launching their new wide bodies into this market niche , some think the 777 , which wo n't be delivered until at least 1995 , has advantages . Mr. MUSSER : With a twin engine aircraft- The MD-11 is a three-engine aircraft . So I think there 's probably a 10 percent cost advantage , on an operating basis , for the 777 , versus the MD-11 @!VANOCUR voice-over And labor conflict at Boeing , which suffered a 48-day strike by the machinist union last October , should be minimal . The machinists settled . And a strike threat by its 27,000 engineering and technical workers no longer exists . CHARLES BOFFERDING , Union President : We 've just settled a contract . We have a period of peace , if you will , for the next two-and-a-half years . We 'll negotiate again in ' 92 @!VANOCUR voice-over So most observers think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain its dominance . The company already has a 54-percent share of the commercial jet market , followed by Europe 's Airbus Industries with 22 percent and McDonnell Douglas with 18 percent . Yet there is at least one dissenter to the view that there will be nothing but blue sky for Boeing and Seattle , the city it dominates . If the world economy turns sour , history could repeat itself , says industry consultant Jordan Greene . Mr. GREENE : There will be cancellations . If things get bad enough , there was a sign at the last recession that said , \" When the last man leaves Seattle , will he please turn off the lights . \" VANOCUR : That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Sander Vanocur . On behalf of everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223865 @!SANDER-VANOCUR : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur , and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice over The silver lining in the Persian Gulf cloud : The Mideast crisis means potential profits for companies as diverse as K-Mart and water bottlers . We 'll look at firms that may have the chemistry to survive adversity . From Washington , this week 's Business World guest , Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner . Also this week , bringing fiber optics to the home : it could mean exciting ways to communicate . Critics say it could also mean higher costs for phone service . And Peace Fleece : a yarn about a Maine-to-Moscow venture that pulls the wool over some eyes and hopes to pay a peace dividend @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World , with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR The mobilization of the U.S. military in the wake of Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait is the largest since the war in Vietnam . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the so-called peace dividend from the democratization of the Eastern Bloc . Instead , we 're treated to pictures of warships , tanks and troops being loaded onto ships and being deployed in the Saudi desert . All of this activity means more business for those companies supplying the military . As business editor Stephen Aug reports , it 's another case of a cloud with a silver lining , at least for some . STEPHEN AUG : voice-over In the movie Bananas , Woody Allen plays the leader of a band of South American guerrillas . In this scene , he walks into a tiny cafe to get food for his troops . \" Bananas \" MGM/UA WOODY ALLEN , Actor : Do you have any grilled cheese sandwiches ? ACTOR : Yes , sir . Mr. ALLEN : Well , let me have a thousand . And 300 tuna fish and 200 bacon , lettuce and tomato sandwiches @!ACTOR You want cheese on rye ? AUG : voice-over Far fetched , you say ? Not really . When elements of the 24th Mechanized Infantry at Fort Stewart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the local K-Mart store got an urgent telephone call for special supplies , including 5,550 each of suntan oil , skin lotion , lip balm and foot powder , 2,400 cans of bug repellent , 45 automobile compasses , and 60 white toilet seats . Why go outside routine Army supply channels ? WESLEY BENEFIELD , Manager , K-Mart , Hinesville , Georgia : If it was needed in Saudi Arabia today , why wait three weeks to get it ? Would you want to be in Saudi Arabia without suntan lotion ? AUG : voice-over The huge American deployment in the Middle East , and the fears that go with it , are proving a boon to a lot more business firms than just K-Mart . Like Survival Technologies . At their plant in St. Louis , they make automatic injector kits used to dispense nerve gas antidotes . Survival is the only domestic firm that makes them . And a few days ago , they got an order for 420,000 from the Defense Department . JAMES MILLER , President , Survival Technologies : Our employees are really quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on the weekends , and so we plan to use overtime and weekends to make up for whatever is needed by our Department of Defense or other military @!AUG voice-over And then there 's the Camel Manufacturing Corporation near Knoxville , Tennessee . They make tents . They also make special suits used to protect people from poison gas . Two months ago , before the Iraqis invaded Kuwait , they got an order for 1.3 million protective hoods . CHRIS ARNOLD , Camel Manufacturing : Since the invasion , we 've kind of stepped up to another gear . We went into overtime , and the atmosphere has changed , there 's a sense of urgency in the air @!AUG voice-over The buildup and higher oil prices mean other businesses may benefit as well . BRUCE STEINBERG , Economist , Merrill Lynch : A list of winners is a pretty short list . It 's mainly companies in the energy complex itself . Obviously , the oil companies are going to do well out of higher oil prices . Natural gas producers are going to be doing better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other parts of the oil industry should also do well . But that really depends on prices . The benchmark domestic crude oil , West Texas Intermediate , hit a low of $15 a barrel in late June . Then it began rising . By late July it was $18.50 . On August 2 , the day the Iraqis invaded Kuwait , it was about $22 . Now , it 's trading around $27 . Analysts say a price of around $25 a barrel for at least six months could mean some big changes in the energy industry , especially oil field equipment , drillers and servicing companies . ADAM SIEMINSKI , Washington Analysis Corporation : If prices stay up , there is going to be a greater demand to look for oil in the United States and all over the world , and those companies will end up getting more work . Alternate fuels will also benefit @!AUG voice-over That means firms that make fuels like ethanol , which is made from corn by firms like Archer Daniels Midland , and methanol , which comes from natural gas and coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits in banking . L. WILLIAM SEIDMAN , Chairman , Federal Deposit Insurance Company : At the moment , I would say that the higher oil prices , under current conditions , will probably help us by helping the Southwest , where we have by far the largest number of failures @!AUG voice-over The Texas economy in general my benefit . For every dollar , the price of oil rises above $20 a barrel , about 15,000 new jobs are created . So if oil remains around $26 , that 's about 90,000 new jobs in Texas , an increase of about 1.2 percent in total employment . STEPHEN BROWN , Economist , Federal Reserve , Dallas : It 's no reason to go out and buy a new Mercedes . I guess I probably should n't say something like that , but it 's good for the Texas economy but it 's just not that good . It helps , but not by very much . It 's not going to return the Texas economy to the boom that it saw in the late 70s and early 80s @!AUG All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least a few may get some benefit . Though on the whole , the economy , most observers consider the higher oil prices and potential problems arising from the Middle East crisis to be overwhelmingly on the down side . Sandy ? VANOCUR : Thanks , Steve . In just a minute , the impact of the Middle East crisis on the cost of getting around from Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner . Commercial break VANOCUR : The crisis in the Middle East has once again pointed up American vulnerability because of our dependence on imported oil . Oil is the major fuel for our entire transportation system . From airlines to cars , from locomotives to trucks , all rely on oil . All are being hit by higher oil prices . And the higher prices and fears of shortages have n't been lost on this week 's Business World guest , Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner , who joins us from our studios in Washington . Mr. Secretary- SAMUEL SKINNER , Secretary of Transportation : Good morning @!VANOCUR Good morning . Your department has been working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the end of the year . What are the repercussions from the present crisis going to be on that report ? Sec @!SKINNER Well , it 's too early to tell but Jim Watkins , the Secretary of Energy , has been working on the national energy strategy , and the Department of Transportation has been working very closely with him . It 's to be presented in December and I think it 's going to be based on a number of assumptions that probably are no longer valid . It 's pretty clear that they 've been very concerned about the dependence on foreign oil , which as you know has gone over 50 percent , and I think that now they 'll be looking for alternative ways of generating energy , and some of the alternatives may have a higher priority than they 've had in the past @!VANOCUR Can we learn anything from what the Japanese have done in this area ? Sec @!SKINNER Well , obviously the Japanese are dependent even more than this country on foreign oil , and as you know they 've moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're kind of at a plateau in the area of nuclear energy . Whether or not nuclear energy will play a bigger role or not I think will be part of the national energy strategy . It 's certainly an option that they 're going to be looking at @!AUG Relatively little of our electric power in this country is generated by oil any more . And you 're right about nuclear ; it 's not only on a plateau as far as new project , there 's nothing , absolutely , on the drawing boards . Do you know if the administration would favor more nuclear plants ? Sec @!SKINNER Well , I think it 's pretty clear that the Secretary of Energy and the administration are going to be looking at all the options . This is really a project being led by the Department of Energy . But I know from my work with them that they are really exploring all options , and they 're leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to find viable options to dependence on foreign oil @!AUG Well , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you encourage people to use mass transit ? Clearly , you do n't encourage them by taking away operating subsidies and driving the costs up . What are you going to do to get people to use mass transit ? Sec @!SKINNER Well , we of course have got a program that has been gradually dwindling down and putting more reliance on state and local sources of revenue . They 've become too dependent on the federal government . I think as part of our desires in the area of energy conservation and our objectives , it very well may be that mass transit , in next year 's budget , in the out year budgets , may get a bigger share of federal funding as well as an encouragement for greater local funding @!VANOCUR Mr. Secretary , in the last few days the government has requisitioned civilian aircraft . If this continues , and more requisition , what effect will this have on what 's left of summer travel ? Sec @!SKINNER Well , as you know , the summer travel period is probably the biggest , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call up yesterday by the transportation command , they will have access to about 38 different aircraft , many of which have already been used , but they 'll have a little more flexibility . We do n't anticipate at this level of call up that there 'll be any dramatic impact , although travelers will be inconvenienced because airplanes are currently in use , especially the big jets , the DC-10s and the 747s , are going to be diverted from their normal passenger runs , which are in most cases almost full , to a civilian run , and then the passengers are going to have to be picked up later @!VANOCUR Very quickly , in terms of what you just said , that the Energy Department should take the lead , why should n't Transportation take the lead ? After all , about a fifth of our gross national product is based on transportation and services attendant to it . Why should n't you lead rather than energy ? Sec @!SKINNER Well , we 're very involved . It 's a joint effort . But every project of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Energy has energy responsibilities for not only the transportation sector but all of the sectors , so it 's the logical choice and we supported the effort by Secretary Watkins and we 're very deeply involved . And the decision will be made by the President after listening to everybody . But you have to have a leader , and Jim Watkins , with his experience in the energy field , as well as experience in the military , is the perfect guy to do it @!VANOCUR Thank you very much , sir . Thanks for joining us here on Business World . Turning to the week on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell , the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down for the week by almost 72 points . Last week , our panel of stock market experts from around the country were split . And for the week ahead , it 's split again . Some of our panelists , including Los Angeles-based market timer Peter Eliades , say the trend is down and any rally will be a short one . PETER ELIADES , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it 's come down , we can always anticipate some kind of rally . There are always people that are bargain picking . I would say that any rally would have a cap on it in the Dow of around 27.35 to 40 . However , I 'd be very surprised to see the Dow get above that level again on a closing basis @!VANOCUR When we come back , the phone company 's hope that when it comes to new technology , regulators will see the light . Commercial break VANOCUR : For many Americans , long- distance phone calls have been sounding clearer over the past few years , in part because the majority of those calls are traveling on strands of glass instead of wire cable . That glass , known as fiber optic cable , holds out the promise of a host of new communications services , which so far are beyond the reach of the consumer . But as with other new technologies , not everyone sees the future quite so clearly . voice-over In the future , we might get pink slips via fiber-optic-supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pictures are absolutely phenomenal and the sound on it is terrific also @!VANOCUR voice-over Santo Rocca is one of a handful of Americans who can watch sparkling clear television , though not HD-TV , thanks to fiber optic cable built into his new home in the planned community of Heathrow , Florida . Rocca 's house is one of 50 test homes with fiber optic services built in by Bell South using equipment and services from third parties , including Northern Telecom and AT&amp;T . But for the rest of America , getting fiber and fiber services probably means retrofitting , as in this experiment in Cerritos , California , and it 's become a major policy debate involving telephone companies , cable television , and even the question of whether the U.S. retains its lead over Japan in the photonics industry . GEORGE GILDER , Senior Fellow , Hudson Institute : It 's the single most important development in communications technology . I mean , today you can send 8.6 giggabits of information a second - that 's about 1,000 Bibles a second between Chicago and the East Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Communications Commission : We 're talking about a hair-like fiber being the equivalent of this obvious thick and heavy conduit filled with twisted copper paris , and it 's just amazing that one-quarter pound of this is equal to about 33 tons of this @!VANOCUR voice-over Replacing all the existing copper wire with fiber optics today is estimated at half a trillion dollars . So why do it ? Senator ALBERT GORE , ( D ) Tennessee : I think we 're in the early stages of an information revolution that will make fiber optic cable far more important in the future than it is today @!VANOCUR voice-over Dataquest estimates that eventually there will be a $150 billion a year market for fiber services - everything from this Fujitsu picture phone to televised traffic reports and interactive television , which might let you cull through stories in a newscast . Videoconferencing takes on new dimensions with this device from Belcore . Technologies like these might change not only how we work but where , allowing millions of commuters to get off the roads . Mr. GILDER : It can relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , it really will be possible to have a birthday party for grandma with kids all around the world assembling at the foot of her bed at the nursing home in Florida @!VANOCUR voice-over Part of the debate centers on what services will come on fiber . While a single fiber optic strand can carry voice and video , it takes different kinds of switches to convert signals from electricity to light and back again . And those for television are far more costly . Fiber optics have been cost effective for long-distance telephone service for years . Since first developed by Corning Glass , fiber has come down to one-seventh its original price , making it now competitive for new local phone service . But the most heated question in the fiber debate centers on the claim by the baby bells that the best way to speed fiber installation is to let them into cable television , an area from which they 're now barred . Mr. SIKES : If the policies that limit what telephone companies can do are not changed , are not altered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will begin to have a very chilling effect on network modernization , and the potential for deployment of fiber into the home @!VANOCUR voice-over But there are some fears that it will be the phone user who pays for fiber , wanted or not . GENE KIMMELMAN , Consumer Federation of America : The problem with the phone companies and fiber optics is they want rate payers , who have to pay their local monthly phone bill , to take the risk in their phone rates for a very speculative , possibly promising but extremely high-risk venture @!VANOCUR voice-over But the baby bells say they already have $22 billion a year to invest in new plant and equipment without raising rates . RICHARD SNELLING , Executive Vice President , Southern Bell : If we 're never allowed to do CA-TV , we will still do fiber to the curb and then fiber to the home , because it is cost effective to do it for plain old telephone service @!VANOCUR voice-over How soon will all this happen ? A number of the baby bells say they 'll start providing new phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for wide ban services like television ? JOHN SODOLSKY , President , U.S. Telephone Association : Right now it is simply not economic for telephone companies to run fiber to a house , at least not at the speed we 'd like to . While we 're talking about speed , I 'd like to talk about how quickly this could be done if we were able to start today , if the restrictions were removed . I would venture that within 10 years a majority of America would be fibered @!VANOCUR voice-over And if those restrictions are not removed , the experts say it could take an extra 10 to 15 years to install fiber across America , long enough to cost the U.S. its lead in fiber optic technologies . Japan is already targeting fiber as well as the kinds of wide ban switches that in the U.S. are only found in some 1,400 telephone central offices and networking centers . Mr. GILDER : And when the Japanese start making millions of something while we 're making 1,400 , you know who 's going to dominate all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Soviet-American joint venture out to fleece the public . Commercial break VANOCUR : The crisis in the Middle East has found the United States and the Soviet Union on the same side of a major international incident for the first time in many years . Improved relations between the two superpowers have prompted joint ventures and dreams of convertible currency . But while some firms may be counting their kopeks , one joint venture is counting sheep . voice-over It 's daybreak , a foggy morning in Keyser Falls , Maine . Peter Hagerty is no ordinary sheep farmer . He runs an international business , a joint venture with a Soviet partner . Hagerty imports wool from the Soviet Union , blends it with his own wool , and calls the company Soviet American Woolens . He calls the yarn \" peace fleece . \" A sweater made from Hagerty 's yarn is for sale at that venerable main institution L.L. Bean . PETER HAGERTY , Soviet American Woolens : The customer that I 'm most excited about getting is the person that comes to us not because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!VANOCUR voice-over The yarn comes in 15 colors with post-Cold War names like Soyuz-Apollo blue and glasnost gold . It 's mostly a mail-order business with 7,000 customers . And Hagerty runs a small retail shop in his barn . Mr. HAGERTY : This design right here was made by a woman in Moscow @!VANOCUR voice-over The business has diversified . Hagerty ships knitting needles and wooden buttons to the Soviet Union , where students paint colorful ethnic designs . Hagerty 's Moscow partner , Victoria Butenko . VICTORIA BUTENKO , Soviet American Woolens : It took a long time for every student to understand that for the United States you have to make the highest quality you could . And you could n't make any defect in any item @!VANOCUR voice-over The co-op churns out 10,000 knitting needles a month , and 10,000 buttons . Students are paid on a piecework basis , one ruble per item . They also make porcelain sheep , 2,000 a month at five rubles apiece . At those rates , students can earn more in a few hours after school than their parents earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 300 students . Ms. BUTENKO : It 's number began to grow like mushrooms after the rain , and soon , in one year , we 've had 20,000 of kids from 43 schools . Mr. HAGERTY : Well , we 're in the fortunate position , basically using our Soviet partners as a manufacturing facility . We send them over the raw materials , they manufacture the product for us , we bring it back to the United States and sell it for dollars . So we never get into rubles @!VANOCUR voice-over Getting profits out is no problem . But there are problems with Soviet thugs . Mr. HAGERTY : Last year , we had one of our co-ops shot up with a gun , the sign out front was shot up with a gun , the van was burned , one of the students was badly beaten , and the message was that \" if you do n't pay us protection money , we are going to see that you are hurt , \" and the way that my partner responded to that was she picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city @!VANOCUR We 'll be right back . Commercial break VANOCUR : That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Sander Vanocur . On behalf of everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223866 @!SANDER-VANOCUR : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur , and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice over Labor Day weekend , and organized labor is still fighting , now battling companies trying to save money by using contract workers instead of permanent employees . From Washington , this week 's Business World guest , head of AFSCME , the public employees union , Gerald McEntee . And the best companies to work for : a look at some firms where the fruits of your labor can bear even more fruit . Also , back in the USSR : fringe benefits at a big company can help you where you live . And GrandTravel : For a few grand , grandparents and grandchildren travel in grand style @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World , with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR This may be an unsettling Labor Day weekend for many American workers . Unemployment is drifting upward , the economy is trending downward , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auto Workers have begun talks with the Big Three U.S. automakers . And postal workers are bargaining with the Postal Service . As business editor Stephen Aug reports , where once workers aimed at improving their lot , now they 're just trying to hold on to what they 've got . STEPHEN AUG , ABC News : voice over When both sides got together for the start of the year 's biggest labor negotiations last week , covering more than 600,000 postal workers , there were the usual handshakes and pledges that everybody really wanted the same thing . VINCENT SOMBROTTO , President , National Association of Letter Carriers : If you 're sitting on your side of the table and you want to get an agreement , I can assure you on our side of the table , we want to get an agreement @!AUG voice over But behind the smiles and handshakes and the usual issues of wages and benefits , one of the most contentious issues is : 1st POSTAL WORKER : Job security . The money is n't that important if we can just keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll start , you know , laying people off , I really do @!AUG voice over What they 're really worried about is machinery like this . This machine handles letters that can not be read by ordinary sorting machines . In this case , it transmits a picture of each envelope to a worker at a remote location , who reads it and punches the address into a computer that sprays a bar code on the envelope . The bar code contains the routing , and off it goes . The problem is that the Postal Service wants to contract out this work to non-Postal Workers . Postal officials say this is only part time work . ANTHONY FRANK , Postmaster General : I do n't want to hire people for 30 years and give 30-year employment to our people for a job that 'll disappear in eight to 10 years , and the rate differential between contracting it out and doing it in house is $12 an hour . Now that 's a lot of money . That 's about $300 million a year . MOE BILLER , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he does n't have to do it here . He can just get a satellite and have it done at Bangladesh for about $1 a day or $1 a week @!AUG voice over Frank says the operation will eliminate about 12,000 jobs over the next four years . But that will happen through attrition ; nobody gets fired . The Postal Service already contracts out about $4 billion a year for services , like mechanical work , maintenance , air transportation and rural delivery . But this , the unions say , is different . Mr. BILLER : But now , in the mail processing , that 's a core activity that 's the heart of the Postal Service as we know it . He contracts that out , then you 've got all over again just delivery and there 's nothing to prevent them from contracting out delivery except the United States Congress @!AUG voice over And outside observers say Biller should be worried about future employment . Prof. DAVID LEWIN , Columbia University Business School : If you were a leader of one of the Postal unions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and ask yourself , \" Are we talking 12,000 a day and 100,000 five years from now ? or are we talking 12,000 a day and that 's about it ? \" AUG : voice over In fact , it 's far from just the post office that uses outside contract labor . RICHARD JACOBS , Senior Vice President , AT Kearney Incorporated : Recent surveys showed that more than 90 percent of American companies are now contracting a sufficient portion of their training needs outside . Better than three-quarters of the companies in this country are contracting their information services needs on the outside @!AUG voice over At Norrell , a major supplier of contract employees , they say there 's good reason for the growth in contract workers . GUY MILLNER , President , Norrell Corporation : The reason for that is that it allows them time to spend their own management resources on the re-training and the development of their core employees . We 've got , between now and the year 2000 , we 've got to train 50 million people , either train or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hewlett Packard , EI Du Pont , AT&amp;T and IBM . Still , there are concerns . Mr. JACOBS : The quality can suffer . There is a degree of consistency , but as I 've described it before , it 's kind of like getting Pablem : you know what you 're getting but it 's nothing spectacular @!AUG voice over There 's also a question of loyalty : how loyal is a temporary worker likely to be ? But loyalty can cut two ways , especially following the corporate downsizing of the 1980s . Prof. LEWIN : The message that that sends to newer people coming into the work force is , \" how loyal do I want to be to a company if at some point down the road , I have invested my loyalty and the company says , ' well , we 've run into difficult business conditions and now your job must be eliminated ? \" or \" you must go ? ' \" AUG : And it 's not just private industry and the federal government that are using contract workers . Even state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is more bad news for American labor unions . Sandy ? VANOCUR : Thanks , Steve . In just a minute , we 'll talk to someone who has a major stake in the matter of contract labor , Gerald McEntee , head of AFSCME , the huge public employee union . Commercial break VANOCUR : Working for the government civil service has generally been considered among the most secure employment there is . But in an era of tight budgets that may be changing . This week 's Business World guest heads the 1.2 million member public employee union AFSCME , the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees . Gerald McEntee joins us from our studios in Washington . Mr. McEntee , after the 1988 election , your union paid for a poll taken I believe by a Republican and a Democratic pollster , that showed that the people in this country want more government programs not fewer . One , does that trend still hold ? And two , what does it portend for your union ? GERALD McENTEE , President , AFSCME : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it shows time and time again that people want more government services based on the fact that through the decade of the 1980s under the Reagan administration , they lost so many government services , not only at the federal but at the state and local level , and I think that 's a very good sign , I think it 's a very necessary sign , in terms of the future for America , and based on the poll and other developments we look forward to that future @!VANOCUR What 's the single most important element that your workers want ? Is it health care maintenance ? Mr. McENTEE : Well , right now -- well , obviously it 's wages because public sector workers have historically been behind their counterparts in the private sector . But right now , I guess almost equally important is the spiraling health care costs . Every time we go now to the collective bargaining table , the employer is attempting to either take away benefits or make our people , the people that we represent , pay more in terms of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , right at the top of the list @!AUG With most unions losing members , yours is one of the few that keeps gaining them . What 's the reason ? Why do you people keep gaining members ? Mr. McENTEE : Well , we gained , just in the past year , 41,000 . Through the decade of the Reagan administration , which was tough , difficult and challenging , we grew almost by 200,000 . I think that , first of all , the union is dedicated to organizing the unorganized public sector workers and health care workers in the United States , and we 've put an awful lot of effort into it , and we use an awful lot of different ideas and methods to do just that , whether that 's effective polling , whether that 's the use of television or print media or radio or whatever that happens to be , as well as the standard and reliable one on one organizing drives . But we do a job , we do a job on it @!AUG Evidently , you 're organizing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that health service area . But let me ask you one other thing . Something else that 's growing is the trend towards contracting out . Some municipalities and state governments are doing it , too . How much of a threat is that to organized labor ? Mr. McENTEE : Oh , I think it 's a major threat to organized labor , and not just to the public sector . Some people call it contracting out and privatization in terms of the public sector . In the private sector it 's called contracting out and outsourcing . It seriously affects the UAW , it seriously affects a union like The United Steelworkers of America . We find public officials wanting to privatize the delivery of public service into private hands . Where we have seen it happen over the course of the past , and watched it in operation , it has generally been a failure . Not in all cases , but in most cases . We believe , and we think we can prove , that public services are better delivered in a more effective , efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and employers @!VANOCUR Thanks , Mr. McEntee , thanks for joining us here on this Labor Day weekend . And when we come back , a Labor Day weekend view of some of the best places to labor . Commercial break VANOCUR : Most American workers get this weekend off in celebration of Labor Day , a time to wrap up the summer and enjoy the fruits of labor . Business World wondered if there are some places where working may bear more fruit than others . We asked four experts to pick the companies where they think the pickings might be best for employees . voice over Tom Peters , the author of In Search of Excellence and In Pursuit of Excellence , gave us his favorites , based on the guiding premise , that there really is no such thing as a great company to work for . But given that , number one on his list is United Parcel Service . He says it 's not bureaucratic , and it can make you rich . But he says if you love Marine boot camp , you 'll love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service : It 's a real personal working atmosphere , they take a personal interest in your life and helping you do things , accomplish things . It 's like a real family atmosphere working here @!VANOCUR voice over The rest of Peters ' list : long distance carrier MCI , personal products chain The Body Shop , Domino 's Pizza , which Peters says really delivers for young people with lots of drive , and Pepsico , which he calls a great place for managers , no doubt the choice for a new generation . The vice chairman of Booz , Allen &amp; Hamilton , Cyrus Friedheim , cites three criteria for his best companies , that employees believe \" I matter and can make an impact ? \" that there 's an opportunity to earn and learn , and that there 's a pride in the values of the firm , and an identification with its mission . On its list , without any ranking , Amoco , McDonald 's , Milliken and Company , Motorola and a company with a contentious labor history , General Electric . CYRUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years , has had a vision , and it has taken the tough decisions to focus on that vision , and part of those tough decisions are spinning off operations which do n't necessarily fit @!VANOCUR voice over The woman who brought us The Preppie Handbook and Going to Work , Lisa Birnbach , rated companies on these criteria : first-rate goods and services , longevity of relationships , a merit system and thoughtful perks . Her picks : 3M , management consultants Bain &amp; Company , Levi Strauss , Leo Burnett Advertising and Delta Airlines . CHARLIE BAUTZ , Delta Performance Engineering : There is a firm policy of promotion from within , so when you come into the company you know you 're not going to be exceeded by some outside person , and there is a policy of an open-door policy where you are free to go to management on any level you want to with any kind of a problem that you have @!VANOCUR voice over Delta must be ready when its employees are because it was number one on the list from Paul Hirsch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best companies to work for , a record for smart management , caring about employees and programs for advancement . Following Delta on his list , Motorola , IBM , Federal Express and Fel-Pro , an auto parts maker in Skokie , Illinois , with benefits ranging from recreation facilities to day care , and even a $2,800 scholarship for advanced education for all children of all employees . on camera Fel-Pro 's perks were so broad that in the not too distant future we 'll be profiling the firm , if we 're not all working there first . In just a minute , a look at perks in the Worker 's Paradise . In the Soviet Union , minding your Ps and Qs at the right company can spare you from queuing up . Commercial break VANOCUR : One way companies can distinguish themselves is in the kinds of perks they offer employees . Benefits like first- class air travel or day care , or college tuition can sometimes make the difference in attracting an employee . But they 're still called fringe benefits . As ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Worker 's Paradise , the fringe benefits that go with working for the right Soviet company can really hit home . SHEILAH KAST , ABC News : voice over The lines are legendary . Soviet citizens queued up for scarce shoes , even in the rain , doing battle over cheese . And the wait for an apartment , especially in Moscow , usually lasts years . But there 's a story behind the lines . Soviet workers can sometimes avoid them , or cut them short , with help from their employer and their trade union . The Slava Watch factory produces 10 million watches a year . It also has set aside enough earnings to build five high-rise apartment buildings near Moscow , just for its workers . Lev Federovitz Akimstvyu has worked at the watch factory 40 years . His wife Tamara retired after 30 . Instead of the seven or eight years most residents wait , the Akimstvyus waited just three years for this big , three-room unit . LEV AKIMSTVYU , Soviet Worker : through interpreter If a plant is constructing a building you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no building or construction at that plant , that means there is no chance of anything @!KAST voice over The huge Vill factory near Moscow is more than a place where 68,000 workers assemble and package refrigerators , tools and trucks , it 's also a spot where once a week or so they can pick up food . Today 's package has no meat , but does include hard to find coffee , as well as milk , butter and canned fish . The price is no different than it would be in a store , but some of these products are n't in the store . And in a store , there would be a line . 1st SOVIET WORKER : through interpreter Instead of spending more time with your children , you waste time in food lines . 2nd SOVIET WORKER : through interpreter The food order used to be much better , but with the present situation -- you know how difficult it is in our country right now , anyway -- this store is a great help @!KAST voice over Orders for food and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Soviet Union , according to official statistics . Many big factories raise their own produce , cows and sheep . Free medical and dental care is a right for every Soviet citizen . But at the watch factory , as at many workplaces , the lines are shorter and the care is better . The Vill factory runs 58 kindergartens for its workers ' children , and charges the equivalent of pennies a day . on camera Another benefit : many factories give workers a 70 percent discount at vacation resorts owned by the enterprise . But since husbands and wives usually work at different plants , they frequently can not take vacations together . voice over Even this stop-gap system of worker benefits has big holes : only about one out of 20 watch factory employees gets an apartment , and food packages are often limited . Many believe these worker benefits would not survive the switch to a market economy and should not . VLADIMIR POSNER , Soviet Commentator : If we go to a market economy , with all of its benefits , I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to disappear . People would by far prefer to be able to go and buy what they want without standing in line , just have the choice out there and browse around and buy what they want to buy @!KAST voice over A new focus on profits may also squeeze the other benefits : the kindergartens , the cheap vacations , the medical care . These children will probably never know the system of worker benefits their parents count on . Sheilah Kast , ABC News , Moscow @!VANOCUR Turning to the week on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week up by more than 81 points . Our panel of stock market experts from around the country correctly predicted the upswing . For the week ahead , our panel 's consensus is again for an up week . Some of our panelists say the market is still oversold . But they 're cautious because of the light volume . Panelist Robert Farrell , technical analyst for Merrill Lynch says the market 's current behavior follows an historical pattern . ROBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 've had did have a give-up stage in it a week ago , and we call that a selling climax , and usually the market rebounds after that for a short time , and then goes back and usually it 's a duller period when it goes back down , and that is one of the buy points in a bear market , which is after a climax , as prices recede back toward the previous lows on lower volume @!VANOCUR In just a minute , traveling in grand style with grandma and grandpa . Commercial break VANOCUR : As millions of children begin heading back to school this week , they 'll go through an end of summer ritual , regaling their classmates with stories of \" How I spent my summer vacation . \" Some took trips that can be simply described as \" grand . \" HELENA KOENIG , Owner , GrandTravel : Grandparents have always taken grandchildren on vacation , but never in an organized group , and I remembers that when we traveled with our children they had a lot of fun when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , well , this might be an idea , if children could friends and grandparents had peers , it would make for a great group @!VANOCUR voice over Four years ago , grandma Koenig started GrandTravel in suburban Washington , D.C. , the grand-daddy of Grandparent Tours . It turned out to be a sufficiently profitable venture , but now there 's competition , including a Kansas City-based tour operator that has sent groups to Germany and Holland . Other groups stay closer to home : Disneyland , the Grand Canyon and Washington , D.C. Even the Smithsonian Museum now offers these tours . The tours are n't all set at a geriatric pace . In Alaska , they pan for gold like miners did in the great Gold Rush , and ride past an active glacier and through white water . But while the activities appeal to both age groups , they offer more than just fun . NOEL RICHARDSON , Grandson : We like traveling together , but it 's nice to have some people my age , too . AMANDA KULIKOWSKI , Grandniece : Get away their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones that bug them . DOROTHY BAUMGARTEN , Grandmother : We 're not getting any younger . I 'm getting old very quickly , I 'm sorry to say , and we would like to spend some time with them , and at home they always have their own activities , and this way we trap them @!VANOCUR voice over While the tours include , everything , even an obligatory fast food stop , the grand style does n't come cheap . Alaska costs over $3,000 per person plus airfare . Yet for those paying on the way , it seems like a fulfilling way to spend their money . MARCIA SCHNEDLER , Syndicated Columnist : As one grandmother told me , \" I 'd rather have my kids , grandchildren , remember me here alive and kicking and traveling with them and having a good time . \" She said , \" They 'll never remember you just for the money you gave them . \" VANOCUR : That 's it for this week .

", "\r\n##223873 @!STEPHEN-AUG : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Stephen Aug and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice-over Oil , at the center of the Persian Gulf crisis . What happens to world oil prices and supplies if oil breaks out in the Middle East ? And what might even higher oil prices do to an already weakened U.S. economy ? From New York , this week 's Business World guest , Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher . Also , retailing in trouble . This Christmas , stores got Scrooged , and there 's no upturn in sight . Are there just too many stores to survive ? And used compact discs . Is this one case where the promise \" as good as new \" really rings true ? ANNOUNCER : From ABC News , this is Business World , with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , substituting for the vacationing Sander Vanocur , is Stephen Aug @!AUG This weekend the world is holding its breath , waiting to see if last-minute efforts will head off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war itself has thrown still another monkey wrench into an economy already plagued by a recession , budget deficits , troubled banks and higher fuel prices . For business firms which need to be able to make plans , the uncertainty itself is extracting a price . voice-over After five months of a steady troop build-up in the Persian Gulf and the continued stand-off with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , world financial and commodity markets have become accustomed to uncertainty . But what if war breaks out , say a short war ? ROBERT HORMATS , Vice Chairman , Goldman Sachs International : After the first bullet is fired there 's probably going to be a significant decline in the Dow , maybe 200 or 300 points , and probably a major decline in the bond market . After that , once it 's clear that the United States is dominating the war , that there 's relatively little damage to Saudi oil facilities , we expect the markets to reverse themselves and both the bond market and the stock market should rally @!AUG voice-over Crude oil prices , now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but how far ? That depends on who you ask . THOMAS BURNS , Chevron Chief Economist : I would anticipate that prices could get back to $35 to $40 a barrel . I would be very surprised to see them go much further than that unless , of course , there is significant , substantial , sustained damage to Saudi oil production facilities @!AUG voice-over And if there is sustained damage in Saudi Arabia ? Mr. BURNS : Then all bets are off . It 's extremely difficult to determine , in the very initial moments of any kind of an outbreak of war , exactly how much and how serious the damage is and how long it might take to fix . So uncertainty is going to reign . Uncertainty causes prices to rise , perhaps sharply @!AUG voice-over On the home front , meanwhile , the economy is in recession . Business is slowing down . For the most part , business firms have been cutting back on everything from advertising to hiring to purchasing . Planning in such an environment is difficult , at best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JERRY JASINOWSKI , President , National Association of Manufacturers : Everything I hear from business is that the prospects of war have added to their uncertainty , causing them to trim their buying decisions in general , with the exception of their buying decision for oil , where they 're probably buying more in order to protect themselves against future shortages @!AUG voice-over Oil continues to cause dire problems for the airline industry , which is forecasting record losses this year of about $2 billion . The soaring oil prices already have sent two major airlines into bankruptcy , Continental and Pan Am . And unless prices fall soon , the airlines face more turbulence this year , and it 's not just the airlines . Mr. JASINOWSKI : The possibility of war here increases uncertainty and is bad general economic conditions for most of industry @!AUG voice-over The automobile industry is one victim of the uncertainty . Consumers , worried about the prospect of war and suffering financially , have slowed down buying . RICHARD CURTIN , University of Michigan : Overall , consumers are less confident today than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in fact , confidence is now at the level that we 've only recorded during recession periods . So it is indeed at a very low level @!AUG voice-over In fact , the ABC News/Money Magazine consumer confidence index , which began in 1985 , is at near-record lows . And most Americans rate their personal finances poorly . They say it 's a poor time to buy things . Until recently , most were saying personal finances were in good shape . For manufacturers and other business firms , planning seems to center around the recession . Mr. JASINOWSKI : Well , right now businesses are pretty much involved in the classic actions of holding down inventories , cutting employment , reducing capital spending modestly in areas where they think they can postpone it and to some extent , cutting back on production @!AUG voice-over Most scenarios call for a short war , but what if the war is much longer than a few weeks ? Mr. HORMATS : Inflation will be relatively high because of sustained high oil prices , there 'll be concerns about additional government borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market and the stock market as well . Under those circumstance , I think we 're in a for a prolonged period of enormous economic difficulty @!AUG voice-over World War II was , in a sense , good for the economy . It helped pull the nation out of a long Depression . The build-up in Vietnam also helped the nation prosper for a time . Would a Middle East war be good for the economy ? Mr. HORMATS : Those who argue that wars are good for economies because they provide a fiscal boost should take into account that this was is in an oil-producing area and many other wars have not been . In addition , we have a big government debt now , and the cost of this war would add dramatically to the budget deficit , and that would hurt as well @!AUG voice-over And what if peace breaks out tomorrow ? Mr. HORMATS : It means that consumer confidence in this country improves dramatically , which also will give the economy a boost . Good for the stock market , good for the bond market and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world is virtually awash with oil , by some estimates a 96- day supply in storage . The U.S. strategic petroleum reserve has about 600 million barrels . The peak of the winter heating oil season is about over . If there is a war , the hope is that oil prices can be stabilized by releasing a few million barrels a day from the U.S. reserve . The hope also is that any war is a short one . In a minute , one man concerned with how the U.S. economy might fare if there is a war , this week 's Business World guest , Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher . Commercial break AUG : When this week 's Business World guest joined us shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait , he expressed concern about the state of the economy and the hope that a lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve board might head off a recession . That did n't happen . Now , poised on the brink of a war , the U.S. is troubled by both a recession and huge budget deficits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still deal with the impact of all of these on the U.S. economy . I guess , Mr. Secretary , the operative question is if there is a war , what effect is that likely to have on the economy ? Short war , long war . ROBERT MOSBACHER , Secretary of Commerce : Steve , we believe that if there is a war that it will be a relatively short war and it will not have a major effect on the economy . And when it 's over , when the war is over or when the crisis is over , we think that the demand from consumers and in consumer confidence will come surging back @!AUG In fact , it 's consumer confidence that 's been one of the major causes for the fall-off in economic activity , has n't it ? Sec @!MOSBACHER You 're absolutely right @!AUG In your view , peace will bring that roaring back , or we will we still- we 'll still have worries about the deficit , we 'll still have worries about unemployment that are still there , and a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer confidence comes back , we 'll find that plants will be busier , unemployment will be decreasing and the financial institutions will get stronger , not just because of that but also because this administration is working with the Fed and will be submitting legislation to try and improve the financial- the banks ' positions @!AUG I 'm glad you brought that up . There is a lot of business concern about big banks . We know that before the Bank of New England went under , a lot of business firms withdrew their money and put them in other banks . What 's going to make those banks strong enough so that they 'll be able to lend money ? Some banks even- their capital situation is so low , they ca n't even lend money if they want to . What 's going to make those banks stronger ? What do you think you need to do , in a short phrase ? Sec @!MOSBACHER Well , we 've started doing some of these things , for instance , lowering interest rates is going to help and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough quantities , has started , made the first good steps of lowering rates , one . Two , the reserve requirements for banks have been lowered in some areas , without endangering anything , and it frees up some money for lending , too . Three , the secretary of the treasury and others have called for banks to do what I have said all along , to start lending to those customers who are traditional and worthwhile customers @!AUG But that has n't happened yet , has it ? Sec @!MOSBACHER We think it 's beginning to happen . We think we need to see a lot more of it , and we need to see some new legislation that 'll allow banks to both merge and get capital from other sources @!AUG We know that a number of Fortune 500 companies have been deserting the banks that they 've been dealing with for a long period of time , and going to other banks . To what extent has this lack of business confidence in the banking system contributed to the economic downturn ? Sec @!MOSBACHER Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we now realize , first the President and the whole administration is concentrating on this problem and wants to help make sure that financial institutions in general and banks in particular are in a good position to service their customers . And so we are moving with legislation , we are moving with the regulators , are being careful not to discourage proper loaning- lending , and we find that there 's less movement today and there will be less as confidence comes back @!AUG You 're planning a trip to Venezuela within a day or so and the original reason was the President 's Enterprise for Latin America program , but I gather that there is more of an emergency nature now involving oil supplies . Sec @!MOSBACHER Well , we still have as our basic agenda the ingredients of business- meeting with business , private sector and private sector and our business leaders going down and finding out from Venezuela how they 're moving towards opening their economy for investment and for trade . They 've come a long ways . They 've still got a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil area and world supplies picture , we 'll have with us the deputy secretary of energy , Henson Moore , who 'll be talking about Venezuela 's efforts to help fill the gap , which they 've done very well , of lack of oil coming from the Mid-East because of the crisis @!AUG Well , thanks very much , Mr. Secretary . We appreciate your being with us here on Business World . And when we come back , retailing sent reeling : are we in for a shopping shake-out ? Commercial break AUG : On Tuesday , we 'll find out the latest retail figures . Expected to show what almost every store owner already knows , retailing is down and Christmas was nothing to celebrate . This slump in retailing is prompting a shake-out . Some stores are likely to fold and some , like the store considered shopping heaven for the yuppies of the ' 80s , Bloomingdale 's , are changing their tune . JEFFREY SHERMAN , President , Bloomingdale 's : In the past we had a vision of what Bloomingdale 's stood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone and try to influence and convince the consumer of what they should buy in the store , and tried to almost set their taste level , set their buying pattern , set their habits . This economy and this uncertainty causes you to kind of give them more of what they want @!AUG voice-over What they want , he admits , is better service than they got in the past . How bad is the retailing industry ? Many stores are reporting that , despite early season markdowns , last year 's Santa was downright stingy . WILLIAM FLATLEY , Consultant , Kurt Salmon : In recent memory , I ca n't remember a Christmas when such large stores as Sears , May Company and others have had sales below a year ago , and when you factor in inflation running about three or four percent , that means that they actually sold fewer items at the store level , which is pretty dismal @!AUG voice-over And the $1.8 trillion retailing industry , meeting in New York this week , says it needs all the help it can get , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We clearly need to reduce interest expense . We clearly should not be raising taxes in the face of a recession @!AUG voice-over At Bloomingdale 's , Christmas was flat to slightly down , not much worse than anticipated . Mr. SHERMAN : We bought enough inventory to support the sales projections that we had , and where in past we might have taken more risks in buying more inventory than we thought we might be able to sell in a given period , we also were buying inventory closer to the time we think the customers are going to buy it @!AUG voice-over And though many stores are keeping their own inventories down , the nation 's aggregate inventory might still be too large . KURT BARNARD , \" Barnard 's Retail Marketing Report \" : Are we overstored ? The answer to that is vastly so . Last year , 1990 , we ended up with 36,650 more shopping centers in the United States , 36,650 shopping centers . That is 66 percent more than we had in 1980 . At the time , the population of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retail consultants Management Horizons , we now have 18 square feet of retail space per capita as opposed to nine square feet in 1974 . And conventional department stores are competing with outlet malls , catalog sales , warehouses and specialty discounters like TJ Maxx , one of several stores bucking the gloomy trend . RICHARD LESSER , President , TJ Maxx : Our sales on a comparable basis with last year and our comparison of stores that were open one year or more , were 10 percent higher than a year ago , which is amongst the highest achievements in the country @!AUG voice- over The Dress Barn another specialty chain , opened one-fifth of its 500 stores last year , and they 're planning 46 new stores this year . ELLIOT JAFFE , CEO , Dress Barn : We are very fast on our feet . We can make decisions very quickly here . We do n't have the layers of management that department stores have . We do n't have the crushing load of debt that the LBO department stores have . We have a clean balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anybody @!AUG voice-over A situation , he says , that gives him an advantage dealing with financially strapped suppliers . But department stores have their own advantages . According to Schultz , a former president of B. Altman : Mr. SCHULTZ : Well , if you have a specialty store that specializes in dresses and dresses are out of favor this year , the department store can devote that space to sportswear , whereas a dress store is pretty well locked in @!AUG voice-over But for all retailers , big and small , the change in consumer habits , eroding consumer confidence , the bleak economy and fear of war in the Middle East mean even tougher times . So look for more bankruptcies , mergers and even the disappearance of some more old names . But for consumers- Mr. FLATLEY : Consumers can still be on the lookout for pretty good bargains , but the selection may be thinner . I think retailers are going to take a hard look again at their inventories and edit out any items that are slow movers or fringe items and really focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stores are better off this recession than the last time around because their individual inventories are smaller . During the last recession , inflation was skyrocketing , so stores stocked up in hopes they 'd beat even higher costs . This time inflation is down and there 's less backlog in the stores . Turning to the week on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell the Dow Jones industrials finished down by almost 65 points . Last week our panel of stock market experts from around the country predicted a down week . Our panel 's consensus is for a down week ahead . Some of our panelists say war jitters and some weak earnings reports will carry the market lower . Panelist Peter Eliades , a Los Angeles-based market timer , says this is the time to get your money out of stocks . PETER ELIADES , Market Timer : Currently , all our clients are out of the market in government T-bills , hopefully , or cash equivalents . The reason why we have them there is because we think that we 're in the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good bear market rally from October 11th till the end of December , and we believe that the bear market is about ready to return and perhaps in earnest , and with some vengeance @!AUG Another sign of the times on Wall Street , according to this week 's issue of Institutional Investors Wall Street Letter , loss-plagued Prudential Bache has told its 6,500 brokers the firm will start holding evening and weekend office hours , and in a slap of the wrist at its least productive brokers , the company said the overtime hours will be mandatory for those who produced less than $180,000 last year . When we return , compact discs , playing well on instant replay and resale . Commercial break AUG : How many times have you heard the phrase , \" It 's as good as new ? \" And how skeptical are you of claims like that ? Well , there is one business where used may be just as good as new , only a fair side cheaper . ABC News correspondent Ken Prewitt reports that when it comes to compact discs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compact Discovery : CDs do n't wear like tapes or records , they do n't wear out . The first time you play a CD it should sound as good as the 1,000th time you play it . KEN PREWITT , ABC News : voice-over That 's because , unlike tape machines and turntables , the laser compact disc player makes no direct physical contact with the disc . CDs are also far less prone to harm , and if they 're damaged , you can spot it . And that benefits both people weeding out their collections and the stores that buy them for resale . STEVE BICKSLER , Owner , Penny Lane Records : I 'd say that 95 percent of every CD that comes in here used we will buy , whereas LPs , the percentage is more like 15 percent @!PREWITT voice-over While only 25 percent of American households have players , compact discs now account for nearly 45 percent of total recording industry sales , and though major chains may not be reselling these durable discs , they 've become a mainstay for some small independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manager , Streetlight Records : We decided- we pursued it very aggressively in the beginning , that we wanted to buy used CDs , and we tried to pay the best for them . And it 's been paying off tremendously @!PREWITT voice-over Prices vary with titles , but you can expect to get about four or five dollars cash or a seven- or eight-dollar store credit for a CD that cost $14 new . Mr. MOSS : It 's more profitable than- much more profitable than the new product . Mr. BICKSLER : A new CD that we would put out at $13.79 , that would be a frontline CD , we might make $2.00 on it , whereas a CD that we put out at $8.99 , we 'd made close to $4.50 @!PREWITT voice-over But does this hit a sour note with the recording industry ? Not yet , say analysts , since it probably accounts for less than two percent of sales , and even if it has a significant potential , it may be hard to suppress . MARTIN POLON , Electronic Media Forecaster : Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a public relations point of view , how is it going to look having battalions of lawyers working for the Germans , the Japanese , the English or the Dutch , trying to close down American used record stores ? PREWITT : voice-over Many of which are thriving , he says , in part because they offer a broader selection of classical , country and classic rock than the youth- oriented mall stores . And as the economy slows , the used CDs ' lower price tag may be music to the merchants ' ears . Mr. MOSS : The biggest challenge , really , is getting good-quality used CDs . Everybody is looking for them , and that 's the limitation . If we have the CDs here , we can sell them , it 's practically a feeding frenzy at times @!PREWITT voice-over Ken Prewitt , ABC News , New York @!AUG We 'll be right back . Commercial break AUG : And finally , our winners and losers . The losers , depositors at the Capital Bank of Boston , which was closed by federal regulators on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid off 45 cents on the dollar for deposits over $100,000 . That news comes at almost the same time as the news for this week 's winners , depositors above the $100,000 level at the Bank of New England , where the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to pay depositors in full , in part because some of them were banks that had their money at the Bank of New England to reap higher interest rates . That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Stephen Aug . On behalf of the vacationing Sander Vanocur and everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223874 @!SANDER-VANOCUR-AB : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur , and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice-over Hollywood on the eve of the Oscars . The costs of making movies are out of control . For some studios , there 's no business like show business . For others , there 's no business at all . From Hollywood , this week 's Business World guest , movie producer Thom Mount . Also this week , the showdown between AT&amp;T and NCR . The proxy battle is creating a dilemma for investors . Who are they turning to for help ? And dumping on Indian lands . The Indians could make money by making room for the white man 's garbage , but critics have reservations @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR This is the week for some big prizes for the entertainment industry . Tomorrow night is Oscar night , the Academy Awards , the culmination of a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be called \" the mother of all proxy battles , \" the vote on Thursday on AT&amp;T 's hostile bid for NCR . But as business editor Stephen Aug reports , for those who hold stock in both companies , who wins and who loses is not as simple as the contents of the envelope , please . STEPHEN AUG , ABC News : voice-over It 's just like a world heavyweight championship boxing match . The arena may be different and instead of two heavyweight boxers , the fighters are two heavyweight corporations . The winner 's purse may be worth more than $6 billion . And the odds on AT&amp;T winning its fight for NCR ? PETER LABE , President , Labe , Simpson &amp; Company : There is a 100 percent chance that AT&amp;T will elect four directors . That 's 100 percent . But can AT&amp;T muster more than 80 percent of the votes ? I do n't give them that chance . ROBERT ALLEN , Chairman , AT&amp;T : Maybe it 's an 80 percent chance of getting an 80 percent vote , but that's- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT&amp;T , the stakes could determine its future in the computer business . Reportedly , they 've lost $2 billion in it so far . Mr. ALLEN : We 're looking to build for a long period of time . We want NCR to be our computer business and to take advantage of what we bring to the table , which is the best networking capability in the world and one of the greatest laboratories in the world @!AUG voice-over To accomplish this , AT&amp;T has launched a proxy fight . Either it gets 80 percent of the vote and wins the company , or , with a bare majority , it gets four seats on the NCR Board of Directors . Allen says that would put pressure on the remaining eight NCR directors to make a deal . Mr. ALLEN : I can tell you , I would not one-third of my directors elected to my board without my consent and over my objections . I ca n't imagine that the other , surviving directors would be very comfortable in that situation @!AUG voice-over But NCR Chairman Charles Exley says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chairman , NCR : Well , I 've looked at the candidates they 've put up . I'd- These are not four thugs that they 've nominated , and I presume these people will conduct themselves in a suitable way @!AUG voice-over About two- thirds of NCR 's stock is owned by institutional investors , like pension funds . Those who run the funds say their decision is more complicated than simply whether to take $100 a share for their NCR stock . CAROL O'CLEIREACAIN , New York City Finance Commissioner : We are not arbitragers . We 're in this market for the long term . It 's no accident that we own both of these companies . They 're both good , solid companies and we- our portfolios consist of , you know , most of American industry and , so , our concern is that these companies thrive and do well . And so the issue in front of us , really - is this merger going to make these companies better or is it not ? BRUCE KALLOS , Delaware Pension Fund : As we decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote comes , or the tender comes- is to understand just exactly where that long-term value is . I guess , at this point , my view would be that it 's with the- under the AT&amp;T umbrella @!AUG voice-over To help institutions decide how to vote , a whole new cottage industry has grown up , like Faulk &amp; Company of Atlanta , all the result of a Labor Department ruling that pension funds must vote their shares and justify the votes . Faulk 's firm of 19 people charges for advice by the number of different companies represented in a fund 's portfolio . The average fee runs about $25,000 . ANNE FAULK , Faulk &amp; Company : What we try to determine if asked on that company 's ballot , what is the economy impact it will have on that company , and what 's the impact it will have on the value of the underlying shares ? AUG : voice-over Nell Minow , of Institutional Shareholder Services of Washington , D.C. , which offers similar advice and charges a similar fee , says the AT&amp;T/NCR fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . NELL MINOW , Institutional Shareholder Services : In AT&amp;T and NCR , we did something we 've never done before , which is that we gave two different kinds of advice based on the individual portfolios . We think that the deal is good for shareholders of NCR and bad for shareholders of AT&amp;T , so , based on the mix in the individual shareholder 's portfolio , we advised neither to vote for it nor to vote against it @!AUG voice-over So , an institution whose AT&amp;T holdings are at least five times the market value of NCR holdings would vote against the merger . Why is it bad for AT&amp;T ? Ms. MINOW : Because we really haven 's seen any evidence that they can run NCR any better than NCR is running itself , or that it provides the kind of significant synergies that would make a heavy investor in AT&amp;T do well @!AUG The AT&amp;T/NCR fight is far different from the big deals of the ' 80s . It 's not a corporate raider on a break-apart , destroy-the-company acquisition . It 's a bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' 90s . Now that the end of the junk bond market has dried up financing and knocked most of the individual corporate raiders out of the ring . Sandy ? VANOCUR : Thanks , Steve . Turning to the rest of the action on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell , the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week down by more than 89 points . voice-over Last week , our panel of stock market experts from around the country predicted an \" up \" week . Our panel 's consensus is for a down week ahead . Some of our panelists say the market is going through a normal correction after a big rally . Panelist Lou Holland , a Chicago-based money manager says the market is already looking beyond the recession . LOUIS HOLLAND , Investment Advisor : Well , the market , basically , discounts recession and , so , typically , the recession will extend after you 've had a meaningful rally in stocks . And I think because the Fed has made several cuts in the discount rate and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've had this explosive rally with regard to the market , sort of discounting the worst with regard to a recession @!VANOCUR In just a minute , Hollywood , where red ink is tarnishing the silver screen . Commercial break VANOCUR : Hollywood holds its annual coming-out party tomorrow night - the Academy Awards , when the line , \" the envelope , please , \" precedes the announcement of the winners of the Oscar . But while the world watches Hollywood show off its glitz and glamour , what it wo n't be showing off is a tide of bottom-line busts . voice-over Pretty Woman , Home Alone , Ghost - the three hits of this movie season . Each has earned more than $175 million at the box office . While only Ghost is nominated for an Academy Award for best picture , they all have one thing in common : moderate budgets , each costing less than $25 million to produce . PETER BART , Editor , \" Variety \" : There 's no relationship between the cost of a movie and the success of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making a movie has been escalating rapidly , up 40 percent in the last two years , according to the Motion Picture Association . DAVID LONDONER , Managing Director , Wertheim Schroder : If you look at it now , it costs just under $40 million to make and release a movie in the United States and , clearly , the revenues of these companies from those movies are not going up anywhere near as fast @!VANOCUR voice-over Earlier this year , several studios said that costs have gotten too high , and they 're going to try to hold them down . Mr. BART : This is an era where just part of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's salary for the last film consisted of a jet airplane , so you 're talking about unbelievable amounts of money changing hands @!VANOCUR voice-over The cost problem is so acute that a top film executive at box-office leading Disney Studios said in this memo that , quote , \" We are entering a period of great danger and even greater uncertainty . Events are unfolding within and without our industry that are extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studios is keener than ever . The hit movie Home Alone started off as a Warner project and was dumped at the last minute . Fox picked up the pieces and made the orphan into a $246- million smash . Independent producer Brian Grazer , who made Splash , thinks that experiments like Splash are n't possible in today 's environment . BRIAN GRAZER , Co-Chairman , Imagine Films : Because there are fewer movie studios right now , they 're looking for companies that deliver mainstream , tried-and-true product . That does n't allow for experimentation , as it did over a year- over 10 years ago , and experimentation is a critical part of our business , because it 's an art form and it 's a business @!VANOCUR voice-over And that makes it harder to get pictures made . Super agent Jeremy Zimmer says that economic considerations are overshadowing the artistic merits . That means the next Dances with Wolves might not get made . JEREMY ZIMMER , Partner , United Talent Agency : Unless you 're willing to roll the dice and close your eyes and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in the passion in their eye- unless you do that , the business is going to- what made the business great is going to erode and we 'll all be manufacturers , not creators @!VANOCUR voice-over But even good movies ca n't necessarily save a studio . Consider Orion . It has two blockbusters - Oscar favorite Dances with Wolves and Silence of the Lambs , which is currently number one at the box office . The two films have earned close to $190 million so far , but Orion is essentially out of business , not making any new movies and selling off those actually in production to help pay down some of its debt . Mr. LONDONER : If you have a large amount of debt - and in Orion 's case , the debt is significant - you have accumulated interest costs that can offset the effects of one or two movies @!VANOCUR voice-over Increasingly , the only way a movie can make money is with a good run overseas . In fact , more than half of what a film takes in comes from overseas box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. GRAZER : The international marketplace has become so incredibly important that , in many , many instances , it exceeds in value the- what- the domestic box office @!VANOCUR voice-over Not only are the audiences increasingly international , so are the owners . And on the minds of those \" doing lunch \" in Hollywood these days is whether the Japanese owners of Columbia Pictures and MCA will let their American managers continue to call the shots . Mr. ZIMMER : I think if the studios are successful and make money , they 'll be left alone and it will stay somewhat the same . I think if somebody goes through a real bad run , the Japanese ownership might take a closer look and try and apply a different philosophy to the day-to-day running of the company @!VANOCUR When we return , one of Hollywood 's most successful producers , this week 's Business World guest , Thom Mount . Commercial break VANOCUR : This week 's Business World guest knows Hollywood from two very different perspectives . As the former head of production for Universal Pictures , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , he has a different perspective . As an independent producer responsible for such hits as Bull Durham and Stealing Home , Thom Mount joins us from Los Angeles . Mr. Mount , it 's tough enough to know how to make a picture that makes money in the United States , but since so much money comes from overseas , how do you make a picture that appeals both here at home and overseas ? THOM MOUNT , Thom Mount Film Group : Well , I 'll tell you , the globalization of the motion picture business has put tremendous pressure on all of us to be articulate regardless of national bias or language . I think one of the keys to this kind of international success are stories whose emotional base crosses all sorts of cultural boundaries . You 'll see a film like the recent hit Ghost do very well in Japan , in France , in the U.S. and in Argentina @!VANOCUR In terms of national boundaries , we hear so much about the Japanese , but you 're getting money elsewhere in Asia - are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. MOUNT : Well , I 'll tell you , the finance side of the motion picture business has become completely global . Our company is supported largely by Japanese major corporations for the cost of production of our pictures , but we also involve financing entities in Europe and in other Asian countries @!AUG To what extent is dealing with the Japanese for money any different , say , from dealing with a domestic source of cash ? Mr. MOUNT : Well , the Japanese are tremendously concerned about the quality of the product you 're going to make . This is not always true from other sources . The Japanese are not interested in being associated with motion pictures that are exploitive , are inarticulate , or culturally bereft . They really have a strong , internal , national mandate for high quality @!AUG Are they easier to get money out of ? Do they watch their pennies less carefully ? Because I have the impression there 's so much money there , that it 's probably led to some inflated costs in Hollywood - that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the Japanese learned some very hard lessons here in the last five years . They financed a number of pictures that did n't even receive domestic U.S. distribution . As a result , they 're very wary . They certainly are not spendthrifts or loose with their cash . On the other hand , they appreciate what 's necessary to support the making of a picture that has some serious quality control @!VANOCUR In your city , there 's a famous phrase : \" the final cut . \" Who gets it - the director , the producer ? When you have Japanese money , German money , Taiwanese money , who gets the final cut ? Mr. MOUNT : In fact , the producing entity retains the final cut on all of our films @!VANOCUR All right , look . The one thing this United States is not bereft of is buoyancy of culture - our clothes , our records , especially our movies . To what extent will that continue even though the money 's coming from elsewhere ? Mr. MOUNT : I think it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tokyo and you wander through the nightclub district , the Ropponogi , you see the kind of illogical extension of popular American culture taken to a new height @!VANOCUR I do n't have the money to wander through that district @!AUG Incidentally , in connection with the Japanese takeovers of some of the big studios and their large film libraries , to what extent do you think they 're going to worry about the content of those libraries and prevent distribution of some Japanese films- U.S. films , say , made during the War ? Mr. MOUNT : I think they have an extremely- In my experience , they have an extremely liberal view of these kinds of issues . In fact , they 're very , very self-exploratory in their own television shows and their own , internal mass culture . They want to understand what happened , what the relationship was and what it can be @!VANOCUR Mr. Mount , very quickly , how did this happen , that so much of the capital disappeared from Hollywood ? Is this emblematic of Hollywood or of the entire United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always drawn on off-shore capital . In past years , that capital came from Middle Eastern countries . Currently , Japan has excess capital and a willingness to take the kinds of risks that Hollywood represents . It's- VANOCUR : Thank you very much . Thanks for joining us . Sorry to cut you off . I hope you come back , and good luck with your next movie . Thanks very much . Mr. MOUNT : Thanks @!VANOCUR When we return , will the Indians take the white man 's garbage ? If they get paid for it . Commercial break VANOCUR : The movie many expect will win tomorrow night 's Oscar for Best Picture is set in the Great Plains , on Indian lands . Now , ironically , it 's the white man who 's turning to the American Indians to help solve a problem of the white man 's own making . voice-over Dances with Wolves highlights Indian culture as well as the spectacular scenery of South Dakota 's Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation , where it was filmed . But now , the same Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man 's garbage . The Indians , in partnership with RSW , a Connecticut waste disposal company , plan to cart in garbage from as far away as Denver and Minneapolis . The Sioux would get paid $1 per ton . MAURICE HOBEN , President , RSW : The Indians are well aware that most of the waste that 's going to come to the facility is going to be white man 's waste @!VANOCUR voice-over Nationwide , while some tribal councils seem eager to take the money , other tribe members object . CATHERINE SAUBEL , Los Coyotes Reservation : It goes against everything that the Indian stands for . We are the caretakers of the Earth @!VANOCUR voice-over In the next decade , one- third to one-half of the nation 's 60,000 landfills will be closed . Waste companies are scrambling to find new sites for the future . Indian reservations , which are considered sovereign territories , looked like a new frontier to many waste companies . Due east of San Diego , there 's been a gold rush to secure dump sites at a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) California : There is no oversight by the local county or state governments @!VANOCUR voice-over Federal regulations still apply , but they 're less strict than local California ones . However , the Department of the Interior , which oversees Indian reservations , feels both environmental and Indian economic interests can be protected . TIMOTHY GLIDDEN , Counselor to Secretary of the Interior : Some of these waste management companies feel that they can go out and find some unsuspecting tribe and foist a waste dump on them . I hope that that is not the case . It is our duty to see to it that that is not the case @!VANOCUR voice-over Chambers Development , which plans to create a landfill in the mountainous Los Coyotes Reservation , says it 's not looking for any regulatory shortcuts . ALEXANDER RANGOS , Executive Vice President , Chambers Development : If we had a willing host community in San Diego County that would allow us to build a facility , it would be just as attractive as Los Coyotes . It 's really not a matter of the regulatory process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice-over But members of communities surrounding the reservations worry that the process is too different to protect them . Ed Tisdale has a ranch just below what soon may be a dump for 20 percent of San Diego 's garbage at the Campo Indian Reservation . ED TISDALE , Rancher : That , up there , would be what we would maybe consider the mother of all screw-ups , if they put a dump in on a ground- water dependent area . You do n't do these things @!VANOCUR voice-over But the dumps have made some tribal members angry and they 're beginning to organize resistance . STEVE BANEGAS , Barona Reservation : It will up to the council or the tribe to determine what does n't and what goes in and what does not go in and nobody on this reservation is qualified to single out carcinogens or heavy metals or anything like that . MARINA ORTEGA , Santa Ysabel Band : I feel that it definitely is poisoning the environment . It is not a suitable project for the reservations because of the fact that , after these landfills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with whatever remains behind @!VANOCUR voice-over Yet , despite an age-old tradition of protecting sacred lands , other Indians say economic necessity may outweigh history . Banning Taylor of Los Coyotes says that in a tribe with 100 adult members , most of them are below the poverty line . The $5,000 a month fee that Chambers is paying , with more money to come if the dump is successful , will make a big difference to his people . Campo 's tribal chairman also sees economic benefits for his tribe 's 200 members and he 's convinced the landfill will be safe . RALPH GOFF , Tribal Chairman , Campo Reservation : This project is probably one of the most scrutinized projects in the state right now . We 've really made sure that , you know , the environmental standards are going to be there- are going to be enforced- you know , that we would have enforcement abilities , everything that anybody that cares about the environment would do @!VANOCUR voice-over And the companies , of course , promise to use the most advanced waste disposal technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do - San Diego County - is to close a landfill with no liner system and allow for a new , double-lined landfill to be opened , so I think the net result is going to be a dramatic improvement in environmental protection @!VANOCUR voice-over But some Indians remain skeptical . They remember what they consider a trail of broken promises from whites in the past . WILLIAM BANEGAS , Barona Tribal Elder : It 's what they do . Throw us in the rocks , in the desert , where the lizard ca n't live . Now , they want to corrupt us , corrupt God 's land . We adore this land @!VANOCUR We 'll be right back . Commercial break VANOCUR : That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Sander Vanocur . On behalf of everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223875 @!SANDER-VANOCUR-AB : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice-over Retailing and the consumer driven economy . Once it was shop till you drop , ' now it 's the stores that are dropping . KURT BARNARD , Retail Analyst : Are we over-stored ? The answer to that is vastly so @!VANOCUR voice-over New approaches are winning customers . SAM WALTON , Wal-Mart Founder : We think we 've just begun @!VANOCUR voice-over From Boston , This week 's Business World guest , founder of office supply retailer Staples , Tom Stemberg . Aslo , supply- side economics : retail-style manufacturers run lean and mean . DARLENE FOSTER , Shopper : Everybody is offering a discount so why should you pay full price ? VANOCUR : voice-over And how are you going to keep them down in the malls after they 've seen discounts ? ANNOUNCER : From ABC News , this is Business World with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur. @!SANDER-VANOCUR-AB : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1990 , American consumers spent $1.8 trillion retail dollars . Shopping in the U.S. had almost become a national pastime . The motto , \" Shop till you drop , \" echoed through the mall . In the period 1980 to 1990 , the number of shopping centers went up by 66 percent , while the population increased by only 10 percent , but there 's a sea change under way in shopping habits . Retail space is going begging and , even if consumers do start spending again , their money is going in new directions . This week , our program will focus on the change in retailing : who 's losing , who 's winning , and the retail shopping spree that characterized the decade ends and consumers who once looked toward the top of the line now focus on the bottom line . voie-over Like many baby boomers raising children , Nancy Gabriel says she no longer shops as she once did . NANCY GABRIEL , Teaching Assistant : Before , I used to go in , and style or color was a major thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I do look at @!VANOCUR voice-over With mounting family expenses , the Gabriels put discretion back in their discretionary spending . BILL GABRIEL , Manager : We put several additions on the house and made improvements to the house . Now , as the kids are starting to go into college and getting ready for college , we ca n't do things like that any longer . I 've known people who have blown their whole retirement income on college , so from that perspective I 'm concerned @!VANOCUR voice-over And they 're willing to travel for bargains . One place high on their list is BJ 's - a membership-only , no-frills wholesale club . Ms. GABRIEL : Well , we do basically shop in discount stores . I do not go to retail stores and shop . I hate to say that , but it 's true . HERBERT ZARKIN , President , BJ 's Wholesale Club : The membership concept is one that you feel you 're willing to become a committed , dedicated member . We do n't want a person to come in and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to come in and spend a large sum of money on a fairly routine basis @!VANOCUR voice-over That 's because they need the turnover on a large volume of goods since they operate on a margin of about eight to 10 percent compared to 30 percent for a typical department store . Wholesale clubs are n't the only merchants giving department stores a run for their money . Catalog sales , television shopping , and shopping by computer are all gaining popularity , but the biggest challenge comes from discount stores , specialty shops that narrowly target specific customers , category killers , giant discounters that sell one type of item like office supplies , and outlet stores where manufacturers sell their goods direct to the public . PETER SIRIS , Vice President , UBS Securities : You 're finding two things happening , one is consumers spending less , and then consumers also trading down . You know , they say , \" You know , it 's great to go into a glitzy , fancy store , and here 's somebody playing a grand piano , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles to a warehouse club I can save five bucks , and I 'd rather save five bucks than listen to the grand piano . \" VANOCUR : voice-over Siris says this reflects both a sobering economy and , perhaps , even more significant , long-term demographic trends . Once entrenched in middle age , every generation spends less and saves more . That was true in 1977 , when the ratio of debt to income dropped like a rock from the under-35 to the over-65 's , and it was true in 1988 as well . The best-dressed baby boomers , hung over from the heady 80 's , are less inclined to buy on impulse . In the mid-80 's , Cattiva dresses were made to sell in department stores for about $500 . Now , they 're made to sell for half that price . CHUCK SCHWARTZ , President , Cattiva : People have become much more conservative . People are watching what they spend . People are watching for investment clothing more so than fads , and the dollar 's become very precious @!VANOCUR voice-over Recognizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's of Ohio , an independent store catering to executives , has taken drastic measures . Not only do they make house calls , they follow-up purchases with phone calls . DREW CASHMERE , Executive Vice President , Godfrey 's : We tend to find a lot of little problems that most men wo n't tell us initially , but we find it 's really helped our business . We 've gotten a lot of compliments @!VANOCUR voice-over With independents offering extra service and bare-bones , cost-cutting operations proliferating , traditional retailers are in trouble . After 87 years in southern California , Buffams , which operated 16 stores employing 1,300 people , is the latest venerable institution to join the casualty list . JOHN DUNCAN , CEO , Buffams : It 's really a discount mode that the customer is looking for today . So having someone meet you at the front door and making sure you got treated properly in the store , make sure the clothes fit you properly , and that you know what you 're buying - those days are disappearing for the mass of customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high tech to an old staple - the founder of Staples , Tom Stemberg . Commercial break VANOCUR : This week 's Business World guest is one of the breed of entrepreneurs who has helped change the face of retailing . His office-supply discount chain is a booming success in the Northeast . He got the idea when he visited a warehouse club store for a job interview and saw that shoppers had virtually emptied the office-supply aisle . That was the spark that inspired Staples founder Tom Stemberg , who joins us from Boston . Mr. Stemberg , in contemporary retailing , what is best - bigger , smaller , or niche ? TOM STEMBERG , CEO , Staples Incorporated : I would say the most important thing , if you want to use a term for us , I suppose would be \" niche , \" which is to serve all of the needs of a customer in a given category with everyday low prices and complete selection , just as we 've done at Staples @!VANOCUR When did it change in America ? Because the mall became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing after World War II , when did that change ? Mr. STEMBERG : You know , I 'm not sure it fully has changed . It 's a gradual metamorphosis when the Toys R Us came into being , I guess in the 50 's , would probably have been the single most significant event creating these specialty discount retailers , which dominated categories . Of course , then you have your electronics chains -Home Depot in the home improvement industry - and now , of course , Staples and Office Depot and others in our industry @!VANOCUR But what did people like those people see . What did you see when you made the change ? Mr. STEMBERG : Well , actually , what I was looking for , frankly , from the perspective of a retailer , was that I looked at consumer behavior and saw that , in every category , a dominant chain had taken over that category by offering complete selection and everyday low prices and , frankly , I went out looking for a category that was growing quickly and with the service economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , the office-supplies industry , and Staples , sort of , became an obvious opportunity @!VANOCUR You always emphasize small businesses . Elaborate on that . Mr. STEMBERG : Well , at Staples , what we discovered is that the larger corporations the General Electric 's of this world , the IBM 's - could buy office supplies very inexpensively . The small-business person - the small law practices , to small medical practitioners , the consulting firms , the person who has an office in his or her home - had to pay twice or three times as much for office products . The opportunity was very simple - to find an efficient distribution channel which could offer the big-company prices to small business and carry everything that small business was looking for under one roof @!VANOCUR How have demographic changes affected retailing , and I mean by that an older population - living longer , having more money , too ? Mr. STEMBERG : Well , clearly , the greater affluence has helped all kinds of businesses . I 'd say that the older population perhaps more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tend to cling more to the older forms of retailing , including mall-based retailing . It 's particularly the younger households with two working partners in that relationship , who are pressed for time , who have that very , very strong need to find absolutely everything under one roof at very good prices . That 's the customer for Staples , Toys R ' Us , Circuit City , and all the other category killer stores @!VANOCUR Very quickly - you mentioned pricing , but you also mentioned convenience . Is convenience more important than pricing , or are they equally important ? Mr. STEMBERG : I 'd say those two factors , as well as selection . It 's really all three wrapped into one , which are equally important , and each customer has his own priority list , though I would say price probably would be number one , selection number two , and convenience number three , if you forced me to rank them , Sandy @!VANOCUR I thank you for doing it . Thanks for joining us here on Business World . Mr. STEMBERG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock has been a hot performer - up 66 percent since the first of the year - as have other nontraditional retailers . Home Depot is up 43 percent over the same period , and Wal-Mart , the high-tech discount store founded by Sam Walton , is up more than 35 percent since the start of 1991 . Wal-Mart , with $32.6 billion in sales , has overtaken both K-Mart and Sears to become the nation 's number-one retailer . Walton described one of the secrets of his success . SAM WALTON , Wal-Mart Founder : If something does n't work , we back up and start and try and try and try another direction , and that has helped us over time because , in that process , we 've been able to stay out in front @!VANOCUR At Friday 's closing bell , the Dow Jones industrial average finished the week down by more than 17 points .

AL FRANK , Investment Advisor : We think this is a very healthy market that has a lot further to go . Of course , there will be earnings disappointments and volatility and churning but , over the next several months , we expect the market to advance 10 to 15 percent and feel that people should participate in it , especially in the secondary stocks , which are so strong and outperforming the blue chip stocks by a factor of two to one this year @!VANOCUR When we return - so many shopping centers and not enough shoppers . Are developers getting mauled ? ANNOUNCER : Over the past decade , retail rents have gone from an average yearly increase of nine percent in 1980 down to one percent in 1990 . At the same time , retail-vacancy rates have soared , from 3.9 percent in 1980 to 11.1 percent in 1990 . Commercial break VANOCUR : The downturn in retail sales has been disastrous for states that rely heavily on the sales tax for income . In Pennsylvania , sales-tax revenues , excluding automobiles , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Connecticut , sales taxes brought in five percent less in February than the same month in 1990 and , in Illinois , sales- tax income from March of 1991 was down 11 percent from the year before . And while states worry about how to make up for the shortfall in sales taxes , all operators , facing shortfalls of their own , are hard pressed to offset the loss of customers . voice-over A common lure developers use is the entertainment complex , but that could backfire . CARL STEIDTMANN , Vice President , Management Horizons : It tends to attract an element of the population that is not necessarily there to purchase goods , which is what the mall ultimately has to be about , so you do attract teenagers who are more interested in the scene at the mall and who may actually distract people who would normally come to the mall to purchase goods @!VANOCUR voice-over Real shoppers may be more attracted by attractive prices . Manufacturers ' outlet malls sold about $8 billion worth of goods last year . MARY WESLOWSKI , Shopper : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-hour trip @!VANOCUR voice-over But sometimes , convenience counts . Some downtown malls are capitalizing on that old adage , \" Location , location , location . \" Although the new Columbus City Center in Ohio is not fully rented , their square-foot sales are about $300 - nearly twice the national average , which is down 20 percent from 1980 . Timing , says its developers , was everything . NORMAN PLOURDE , Columbus City Center : I understand that there was over $10 billion spent in downtown Columbus in new office buildings and so on . There are 100,000 workers in downtown Columbus . We probably have more male shoppers because of the downtown components @!VANOCUR Every shopping mall used to be considered a field of dreams - build one and the world would beat a path to your door but , now , as ABC news correspondent Allan Frank reports , some mall operators are looking to creative solutions to keep from losing sleep . ALLAN FRANK , ABC NEWS : voice-over When this blighted section of Glen Cove , Long Island , was razed in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a spiffy , suburban shopping center , but retailers proved hard to attract , so its developer began renting it out as office space for commercial tenants . MICHAEL PUNTILLO , Vice President , Jobco Organization : In terms of the facilities we can offer , typical office buildings would not afford the tenant restaurants immediately within the area . We have extensive parking because of the parking facilities that were built to provide space for retail shoppers coming in @!FRANK voice-over For several tenants , the location works well . SUSAN FRENCH , Manager , Royal Holiday : We 've picked great amounts of corporate business from the- just the mall area here at South . ROBERT TAST , Architect : It 's kind of a nice scale and a friendly environment . It 's worked out very well . In fact , if we had to do it again , we would try to locate in a similar situation @!FRANK voice-over But the center 's lone retailer feels off the beaten path . MADELINE FLORES , Fashion Cove Village Boutique : It does n't bring in much walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all office buildings around you @!FRANK voice-over In Houston , where retail vacancies are a glut on the market , construction is underway to convert a foreclosed mall into something completely different - a hospital complex . JOHN STYLES , Mid- America Health Care : It was a building that had an excellent location for what we were doing . It was very accessible , which is very important for our patients and the physicians that are coming here , and the building was sitting here on 41 acres of land - a lot of parking , a lot of building for the hospital @!FRANK voice-over And buying the property - once valued at $25 million - for little more than $5 million was healthy for the hospital 's bottom line . To cure the ills of retail properties , developers are seeking creative tenants . At this Danville , California , project , the developer gets a kick out of one tenant 's pretty funny idea . By day , it 's a beauty parlor , by night , a comedy club - no kidding . TOM ENBERG , Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and also providing to the community a very unique service or , you know , entertainment opportunity , I mean , that 's to me a real creative retailing approach . That kind of thing , I love to see in a shopping center @!FRANK voice-over Enberg now believes non-retail businesses can not only help fill vacant storefronts , but also can restore character to shopping malls by giving them the vibrant feel that downtowns once had , but he draws the line at some businesses , which project tawdry images . Mr. ENBERG : I do n't want to disparage anybody 's business , but karate studios and check-cashing operations are two of them . You see those in a project , what you 're seeing is a leasing problem , generally speaking , because that somebody 's very desperate to find a retailer @!VANOCUR When we return a look at the retail version of supply side economics .

DAVID ELLIS , Buxbaum Ginsberg &amp; Associates : We 've got a great sale going here , if you need anything just let us know , okay ? We 're getting ready to close down here . KEN PREWITT , ABC News : The people running this sale jokingly say they 're in the growth industry of 90 's - liquidation .

I 'm Sander Vanocur and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice-over Trump 's crown jewel shatters . The Taj Mahal goes bankrupt and Donald Trump tries to restructure his empire . But if the Plaza Hotel becomes a condo , would Eloise want to live there ? From Westchester , the Taj Mahal 's largest bondholder , this week 's Business World guest , financier and airline owner Carl Icahn . Also , the American automobile industry - amid slow sales and foreign competition , the Big Three are languishing . Will the Saturn be General Motors ' shining star ? And the hottest of the imported luxury cars - why is there more demand than supply for these dream machines ? ANNOUNCER : From ABC News , this is Business World with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR Early April car sales figures are due out tomorrow , and if the last reports are an indication , the news is going to be dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sales last month were down 19 percent from a year ago . Automobiles are the largest single manufacturing component of U.S. industry and a slowdown has a broad impact throughout the economy , but as business editor Stephen Aug reports , despite the recession and the downturn in automobile output and employment , at least one automaker is hoping it can find a guiding star - or at least a planet . STEPHEN AUG , ABC News : voice- over The midst of a recession may not seem like the ideal time to open a new car dealership , but for Saturn , the first new General Motors division since 1918 , the feeling is \" better late than never . \" THOMAS MANOFF , Vice President , Finance , Saturn : I 'm elated . Money 's starting to roll in to Saturn and after five years of spending , it sure feels great to have some income coming into the company @!AUG voice-over But it 's not just Saturn and its parent , G.M. , that need the cash . The entire domestic automobile industry is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final quarter of last year was , the first quarter of this year is going to be worse . How much worse ? JAMES BUSH , Editor , \" Ward 's Auto World \" : The worse quarter , probably , in history . The Big Three , as a group , lost $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter and the consensus forecast is on the order of $3 billion in the first quarter of this year @!AUG voice-over The head of automotive operations at Ford agrees . ALLAN GILMOUR , President , Ford Automotive Division : Sales were down in the first quarter , Steve , compared to the fourth quarter of last year , and I think the financial results will be worse @!AUG How much worse ? Mr. GILMOUR : Do n't know yet - still gathering up the numbers - but quite a lot worse @!AUG voice-over One concern is the potential effect of huge inventories of Japanese cars that might be dumped on the U.S. market . While domestic manufacturers shut down operations to control inventories , the Japanese continue producing , storing the excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the heads of G.M. , Ford and Chrysler met with President Bush last month , urging him to retain import restraints . Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca had warned the President that dumping by the Japanese could send their share of the U.S. market from the present 30 percent to 40 . At that level , he said , \" Chrysler is gone and Ford could be mortally wounded . \" Not every U.S. auto executive is so pessimistic , especially at Ford , the lowest cost domestic producer . Mr. GILMOUR : Because of the price position that a good cost position can get , I do n't believe that we 're going to see a big , big increase in Japanese penetration from where it is now @!AUG voice-over While the White House rejected quotas , the automakers ' message might have gotten through . Mr. BUSH : The Secretary of Commerce , Mosbacher , was already- was in Tokyo and , I guess , conveyed to them that we stand prepared to enforce our dumping laws , so , I mean , that 's a pretty strong signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Japanese will pay for it @!AUG voice-over In fact , Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan had suggested the administration might soften its resistance to raising fuel economy standards for new cars @!ACTOR TV Commercial The average driver puts 12,00 to 13,00 miles a year on a car . At Saturn , we knew this @!AUG voice-over Yet , it 's cars like the Saturn on which Detroit is relying to fight the imports . DAVID HEALY , Auto Analyst , Barclays : I think that G.M. has essentially tried to imitate a good , small Japanese car with the Saturn , and I think they 've succeeded . Their aim is to take sales away from imports , particularly in the West Coast markets where they 've started the car , and they seem to be doing this @!AUG voice-over And some West Coast customers agree , like Jennifer Gail Millar , who disposed of a Nissan and bought a Saturn . JENNIFER GAIL MILLAR , Saturn Owner : Design-wise , in terms of the amount of room you 've got in that car- the Japanese models that I tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but forget about going and buying some groceries @!AUG voice-over But problems with the Saturn last fall and winter slowed down the assembly line . The company opted to slow production rather than ship to dealers cars that would not perform properly . LEE LUCAS , Saturn of Burlingame : The first few weeks that we were open , we had hundreds - literally hundreds - of people coming in here every day and we did n't have the cars that we needed to supply those people 's needs , and it was kind of a shame @!AUG voice-over Still , problems continued to slip through . Steve Schaefer , who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area got one of them . The front door has to be slammed to shut it . The steering wheel squeaks . STEVE SCHAEFER , Saturn Owner : -this screeching , scraping sound- AUG : voice-over And the dashboard does not fit properly . Schaefer is a former Honda owner , but he still likes his Saturn .

A rail strike would stop the movement of new cars to market and parts to keep assembly plants going . The result would likely be more shutdowns and layoffs , but the Bush Administration says it 's willing to ask Congress for emergency legislation if that 's the only way to head off the strike . In just a minute , the creditors play the Taj Mahal casino 's Trump card . Commercial break VANOCUR : When Donald Trump made his deal to take over the opulent Taj Mahal casino , then under construction in Atlantic City , he considered it a tremendous coup , but now , as ABC correspondent Allan Frank reports , the coup may be the coup d'grace . ALLAN FRANK , ABC News : voice-over When the Trump Taj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the eighth wonder of the world . DONALD TRUMP : This building is a winner . Nobody 's seen anything like it . The reviews have been unanimous raves @!FRANK voice- over Today , the Taj Mahal is the most conspicuous symbol of tough times for Trump and Atlantic City . As the casino enters its second year of operation , it will be going into bankruptcy . Bondholders , who are owed more than $700 million by Trump , are going to take over half-ownership of the Taj in exchange for reduced interest payments . But bondholders have decided Trump 's management and his much publicized name should remain while he works out his troubles . ROBERT MILLER , Attorney for Bondholders : It 's a fair deal . It 's a fair deal for the bondholders in the sense that , if everything works out , they get their bonds repaid and they get a piece of the upside in the casino , and if things do not work out , they will wind up in control of the casino @!FRANK voice-over With the Taj Mahal deal reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could turn the corner . WAYNE JOSEPHSON , Fitch Investors Service : It will be a close call because Atlantic City is in a recession right now . Even though the Taj Mahal is the most successful casino and the market leader , it 's still generating less cash flow than was expected @!FRANK voice-over With the Taj Mahal under control , if not in the black , Trump will have to spend some time promoting his other properties , the Trump Castle and the Trump Plaza . Both casinos were hurt by the Taj and saw business decline dramatically over the last year . Trump got some breathing room on a $25 million principal payment due soon on the Trump Plaza by cutting an innovative deal with Fidelity Capital . Fidelity traded $25 million worth of Plaza bonds for a mortgage on the casino 's parking garage , carrying about 12 percent interest . Mr. MILLER : It 's amazing that Trump had n't already pledged the parking garage because , up until now , he 'd borrowed against everything that was n't nailed down @!FRANK voice-over At the Castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15th . He hopes to avoid another bankruptcy filing , but Castle bondholders could force him to give up some equity there , too . All 11 casinos in Atlantic City hope and pray they get relief soon . RICHARD BYRNE , Merrill Lynch : We are very optimistic about the longer-term outlook for Atlantic City . The principal reason is the Northeast economy is bound to pick up and secondly , there are no new casino additions planned anytime soon @!FRANK Trump 's credit problems are not confined to Atlantic City . Here at the Plaza Hotel in New York , he hopes to raise cash by converting rooms into condominiums at heretofore unheard of prices of up to $1,600 a square foot . Trump concedes he 's gambling by asking such outrageous prices , but , confident as ever , he insists he 'll get them because the hotel has the best location in the city . voice-over Some real estate experts doubt he can pull it off . LLOYD LINFORD , Reis Reports : His strategy does not represent a slam dunk given the current weakness in Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump 's properties will attract foreign buyers . BARBARA CORCORAN , Corcoran Group : We had a couple from Rome in the lobby of the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue about two weeks ago who had shopped the entire market . They had seen Donald Trump in the lobby that day as we were showing the apartment and they bought that particular unit - paid more for it than they would anywhere else , but they were delighted to be there . They felt they had a little piece of Hollywood @!FRANK voice-over With banks anxious to be repaid more than $2 billion , Trump still has plenty of property to peddle . He 's hoping to hand off the Trump Shuttle to Northwest Airlines in a deal that lets Northwest assume the Shuttle 's considerable debts , and he is still a long way from developing a huge parcel on Manhattan 's West Side he once called Trump City . But Trump 's next task is convincing the New Jersey Casino Control Commission tomorrow that it should renew his license to run the Taj Mahal . Allan Frank , ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Donald Trump 's major creditors and the owner of troubled TransWorld Airlines , Business World guest Carl Icahn . Commercial break VANOCUR : This week 's Business World guest is one of the nation 's best known financiers . He 's the owner of the troubled airline TWA , still awaiting government approval to sell overseas routes to American Airlines in order to raise needed cash . And he 's also the largest single owner of junk bonds in the failed Taj Mahal casino . On Friday , I spoke with Carl Icahn at his office in Mount Kisco , New York . interviewing The conventional wisdom is the junk bond era is over . If it is , then why did some have some disastrous failures or are on the ropes - Trump , First Executive in California - yet you- I do n't think you 're on the ropes . You used junk bonds . What 's the difference ? CARL ICAHN : Well , I think , to begin with , toward the end of the era , a lot of money was spent- a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous prices for companies . As a result , these companies could not sustain the debt load that they put on them . In the case of what I did , with ACF , we issued bonds , but we conserved the cash . And even at TWA , where the airline industry is in terrible , terrible shape , the whole industry- You have overcapacity ; you have tremendous costs , costs going up at 10 percent a year and a recession , so everything is hitting at once . But even at TWA , interestingly , we do have cash . Our problem is not , at this moment , cash , but operating losses . So it was different- it was different with us to the extent that we did not overspend the cash that we got from the junk bonds . And , on the other side , in fact , we used some of that cash , or a lot of it , in the last year to buy junk bonds , and we 've done very well with that portfolio @!VANOCUR The money had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" prudent lender \" ? Mr. ICAHN : All right . I mean , where did the money come from ? I believe- VANOCUR : You and I know where it came from . Mr. ICAHN : I understand , and I think that you 're very right , that it became a tulip-bowl mania . You got a lot of kids out of business school that would just sit there with slide rules and say , \" This company can make it if that company made it . \" Investment bankers that were getting tremendous commissions would tell companies to go in and tell companies to go in and pay any price for another company , or an LBO group to go pay any amount for a company , because everybody was getting a commission . Everybody was feeding at this thing . And it became a mania where they felt no wrong could be done . And we stopped getting involved in buying companies - as did other prudent investors- or prudent LBO buyers , if you will , stopped doing it because the prices were insane . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last three , four years and we said , \" Forget it . \" But now , interestingly , it went the other way and the junk bonds are selling too cheaply , because all you 're doing now , when you buy a junk bond today , if you 're buying the right ones , is- what you 're doing is buying back the equity of these companies at a very cheap price relative to what it sold for , so it 's now- the pendulum has swung too far the other way , in my opinion , but at the beginning , you 're right . Everybody was just going crazy - about two years ago . Not at the beginning , but maybe two years ago , when it just got out of hand @!VANOCUR You 're known for wanting to take over Texaco - a prudent investment ; USX - a prudent investment . You bought TWA - a prudent investment ? Mr. ICAHN : Well , let 's start with taking over Texaco . I think that Texaco was an investment with us . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , necessarily . I just thought the stock was very cheap @!VANOCUR They thought you wanted to . Mr. ICAHN : Well- VANOCUR : Go back to TWA , though- Mr. ICAHN : -people- It 's interesting . Everyone thinks you want to take over companies . Sometimes you do , and- very often , you do . At times , we were thinking of taking over Texaco , but it was a good investment and at times , we wanted it , maybe . But TWA , interestingly , was a good investment at the time . We had made a deal with the unions , if you remember . Otherwise , I do n't think I would have gotten into it to the extent I did . I definitely would n't have . We could have gotten out and sold our position out . We had made a deal with the unions where they gave us very big concessions and things did work out well for awhile . If you had n't had the bombing in Libya- I mean , it 's easy to look back , but even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . But if you had n't had the bombing in Libya and the headaches that we had during the last year , it would n't have- hopefully- it might have turned out a lot better . And even today , we do have a strong cash position , but operationally , as I said , we 're getting hurt @!VANOCUR But is Kirk Kerkorian trying to make a deal with your unions and are you in contact with Kerkorian about what his ambitions are vis vis TWA ? Mr. ICAHN : Well , interestingly , Kerkorian has n't even called me , so it 's a very unusual and enigmatic situation . I mean , Kerkorian is out there saying that he wants to buy this company , but it 's awfully hard to do that when you have n't called the owner , so it makes you wonder . And , as far as I 'm concerned , selling the route is very important to TWA , to our cash position and , basically , to our future @!VANOCUR Thank you very much .

AL FRANK , Investment Advisor : We like the auto stocks right now because they 're so out of favor . We remember back in ' 80 to ' 82 , while Ford was losing money for three years , its stock doubled in price , more than doubled . We think Chrysler , Ford and General Motors are all good stocks trading for less than book value , trading for between 10 and 20 percent of revenues .

I 've never seen one on the road before . \" I mean , it was absolutely a magnet @!VANOCUR voice-over The attention the Acura NSX drew gave McCleod an idea , much better than anything out of Cosmopolitan - what a great way for single women to meet men . Ms. McCLEOD : When this happened to me , I thought , \" Well , great . \" All these single women I know in New York who have trouble meeting great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man you want with this car . ED TAYLOR , Vice President , Acura : I know it really can make you feel good . Because of the distinctive styling , it really is a head-turner . It has terrific eye appeal @!VANOCUR voice-over And that 's just what Acura had hoped for when it introduced the limited production car last August . Acura is only allocating 3,000 NSX 's for the U.S. this year @!ACTOR TV Commercial Recently , Acura introduced what many have called the greatest sports car the world has ever known @!VANOCUR voice-over And using that publicity to help sell the other 140,000 cars Acura hopes to sell here this year @!ACTOR TV Commercial Our latest idea is somewhat bigger : the 1991 Acura Legend . Mr. HEALY : When you go into a Honda dealer and see the NSX , you 're probably going to wind up buying a Legend and when you go into a BMW dealer and see an eight-series , you 're probably going to wind up buying a three-series . I think that , in a sense , these are almost loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell very many of these cars @!VANOCUR voice-over Despite the current recession , two other imported car makers have introduced new , $60,000-plus models . BMW is looking to enhance its prestige and reputation with its limited supply , new eight-series car . RICHARD RUBIN , BMW Dealer : I think that most of the people that shop for this kind of car do n't have an income problem to feel a pinch of a dollar or two @!VANOCUR voice-over The pinch for this new , sleeker model is $73,000 and there 's more demand than cars - not what you 'd expect in a recession . CARL FLESHER , Vice President , Marketing , BMW : We believe that our car prices now are very market-driven and I think most individuals who would look at the price tag of this car would - with a smile on my face - honestly say it 's a bargain @!VANOCUR voice-over And when Mercedes recently introduced its new , top-of-the-line roadster , the 500 SL , it stressed safety , as well as engineering and the company 's reputation . But the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $97,000 car . MICHAEL JACKSON , Vice President , Marketing , Mercedes Benz : I think it delivers outstanding performance in a very exotic style and design , but , at the same time , is a very practical car for day-to-day use @!VANOCUR voice- over That 's what he said - a practical , $97,000 , two-seat roadster . Whether practical or not , to the founder of this exclusive Manhattan restaurant , the appeal of the car is irresistible . FRANK GIAMBELLI , Mercedes Shopper : The style of this one , the model- you know , like when you see a beautiful young lady- that 's why @!VANOCUR Before you buy one of these beauties , remember . The insurance on the Mercedes costs enough to buy a small Honda and if you 'd like to take one for a test drive , do n't count on doing it at the dealer 's , but you can rent one for $400 a day and 50 cents a mile - not just anywhere , but at the Beverly Hills office of Budget Rent-a-Car . We 'll be right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Sander Vanocur . On behalf of everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223877 @!SANDER-VANOCUR-AB : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur , and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice-over Can customers bank on their banks ? What happens to the consumer in a banking industry consolidation ? From Washington , this week 's Business World guest , Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman L. William Seidman . Can his agency handle a banking shake- up ? Also , rising health-care costs put the squeeze on even an expert . Why did it cost this family 60 percent more to have a baby now than one born just four years ago ? And palm-top computers , once considered executive toys - with new hardware and software , the industry appears poised to take off @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR Banking reform is in trouble in Congress . Just this past week , Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady blasted Congress for trying to deal only with the shortfall in bank deposit insurance funds instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This came amid another major bank bailout . The failed Bank of New England was sold to Fleet/Norstar in a deal which is still expected to cost the government insurance fund more than $2 billion . Banking consolidation does n't just mean fewer banks . As business editor Stephen Aug reports , it may mean fewer places where a banking customer can turn for service . STEPHEN AUG , ABC News : voice-over In Texas City , Texas , a community of 41,000 , Mayor Chuck Doyle is a keen observer of the Texas banking situation . That 's because he 's also chairman of the board of Gulf National Bank . And he says the huge mergers and buyouts of Texas banks by out-of-state companies like NCNB of North Carolina may be bad for Texans , but they 're certainly good for healthy , smaller banks . CHUCK DOYLE , Chairman , Gulf National Bank : It 's removed ownership from the personal banking side and that has created a void in understanding between this side of the desk and the borrower 's side of the desk . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent community banker , because we still operate in that personalized service . And , so , in some ways , it 's been a windfall for us @!AUG voice-over Across town , at the Texas City Feed and Supply store , Rusty Schaper says he likes dealing with a smaller bank . RUSTY SCHAPER , Texas City Feed and Supply : I hope that I always- will always have the opportunity to bank with a small-type bank where people treat me sort of like the big fish in the pond @!AUG voice-over Healthy , small banks are not confined to small communities . Even a big city like Chicago has community banks , in this case , a multi-ethnic community where the folks at Devon Bank offer service in 33 languages . RICHARD LOUNDY , CEO , Devon Bank : We wind up taking business from some of these big banks , often , because the customer does n't have a loan officer that he can always relate to . Every six months or every year , they change the loan officer . He ca n't talk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and talk to me @!AUG voice-over Devon Bank and Gulf National are among the more than 13,000 banks in the United States . Add in credit unions and savings and loan associations and there are nearly 30,000 financial institutions that accept deposits and make loans . Include the growing numbers of branches and automatic teller machines and banking is virtually everywhere , and it 's become expensive . JAMES McDERMOTT Jr. , President , Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods : Banking companies need to get this cost structure down . The revenues have been coming down and the cost structures must adjust @!AUG voice-over All of which is leading a growing number of people to say the United States is simply \" overbanked . \" Mr. McDERMOTT : I do n't think there is any question that there is excess capacity in the system , that there are too many banks chasing too few good deals . THOMAS THEOBALD , Chairman , Continental Bank : One way of proving that is that the returns to bank shareholders have been less than in other industries @!AUG voice-over In fact , Theobald 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois Bank , which failed and was virtually taken over by the FDIC . The new Continental handles solely business accounts , so it does business with half the employees it had four years ago . With the banking industry consolidating , those cutbacks are likely to happen elsewhere . Mr. THEOBALD : What 's underway today will mean a reduction of several hundred thousand employees among the million and a half who are working for insured banks today @!AUG voice-over Many of the cuts result from bank failures , going back to the first bank the FDIC ever shut down , back in 1934 , the Fondulac State Bank of East Peoria , Illinois . Today , instead of closing banks , most failures are handled by merging the insolvent bank with a healthy institution . That 's the way the Bank of New England was sold last week to Fleet/Norstar , then the second biggest bank in New England . But unlike other big takeovers , officials promised decision-making will remain in local hands . TERRENCE MURRAY , Chairman , Fleet/Norstar : You give tremendous autonomy to the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Buffalo or Albany or Boston , they are part of that community . They 're part of the fabric of that community and they have very broad decision-making authorities @!AUG voice-over Murray says only about one-third of today 's banks may survive the next dozen years of mergers . Still , most mergers may be among bigger banks , leaving the healthy community banks independent . EDWARD FURASH , President , Furash &amp; Company : The policy of banking in the United States has been to protect small banks , to see to it that local institutions were available to make loans to businessmen and individuals and the whole philosophy has been \" money will be cheap and available to people who want to expand our economy . \" AUG : voice-over And many smaller bankers agree , contending that the nation does not necessarily have too many banks . Mayor DOYLE : We have a decentralized , unit bank state that was here for so long , and we have a lot of independent , community banks and I do n't think the majority of the citizens in Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consolidation continues and in the rush to merge , there 's concern that some banks may grow too fast . At Fleet/Norstar , they say that 's not going to happen following the Bank of New England acquisition . Mr. MURRAY : Their intent is to fully digest it over the next two or three years and not to do anything major during that period , in New England or outside of New England @!AUG That implies no further big mergers in the immediate future for Fleet/Norstar . But what has smaller bankers upset is the prospect that the \" too big to fail \" doctrine is going to remain in effect . Protecting deposits at the big banks beyond the $100,000 limit , they fear , is going to erode their deposit base and force them out of business no matter how well they 're run . Sandy ? VANOCUR : Thanks , Steve . In just a minute , the man in charge of cleaning up the mess the banks leave behind , FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman . Commercial break VANOCUR : Comptroller General Charles Bowsher told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance Fund only has half the money it claims , and that it could be insolvent by next year . For this week 's Business World guest , that 's just the latest in a series of problems which are plaguing him both as Chairman of the FDIC and as head of the Resolution Trust Corporation , charged with the savings and loan bailout . L. William Seidman joins us from our studios in Washington . Mr. Chairman , as a former bank auditor , is the Comptroller General giving you a fair count ? L. WILLIAM SEIDMAN , Chairman , FDIC : Well , we do n't agree with him . It 's an argument among accountants about exactly when we should pick up some losses . It 's really kind of not real world @!VANOCUR All right , the real world is that the last time you were on Business World , I believe you said that you could n't take a hit like the Bank of New England . Well , you 're going to take a $2 billion hit . Could you take another hit like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of New England , but do n't ask me if we could handle two of them @!AUG Well , I 'm going to ask you just that . Could you handle two of them ? Mr. SEIDMAN : It 'd be tight . It 'd be very tight if we had two of that size . We do n't see anything like that coming , at least through the fiscal year , which ends on September 30th @!AUG Let me put that question a little differently . To what extent are there banks out there that you 'd like to close because they 're insolvent and costing a lot of money , but you ca n't because you do n't have the money ? Mr. SEIDMAN : There are no banks , as far as I know , in that condition . In the first place , we do n't close them . The primary regulator closes them . Bob Clark , the comptroller , or the state regulator , so that could n't happen even if we wanted it to @!AUG Well , maybe I phrased the question a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fund is essentially broke . Mr. SEIDMAN : No , it 's not broke . No matter what the Comptroller says , we all agree we have about $7 billion in cash on hand . We can borrow $5 billion from the Treasury on a moment 's notice , because our line is already in place , so we have funding at this time , but , obviously , it 's going down because the recession is taking its toll on banks @!VANOCUR Mr. Chairman , I believe you 've been on Business World more than any other guest , and we 've always danced around but never addressed this question . Is not the banking , the savings , industry , the only form of American capitalism that is virtually risk-free ? Is that not the problem ? Mr. SEIDMAN : Well , it is- I would n't say it 's risk-free , because the stockholders can lose their money in banks , and many have , and outside creditors can lose their money . What makes it different from other industries is that banks raise their funds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so that certainly makes it different from any other industry @!VANOCUR All right , sir . Whatever the reforms are , whoever you 're going to let into it , smaller banks will be closed , larger entities will go in the banking business , but you 're still going to guarantee them the full faith and credit of the U.S. government - are you not ? Mr. SEIDMAN : Well , we 're going to pull that guarantee in some . It 's not going to be as broad as it is now and , more importantly , we 're going to put many , many restrictions on what banks can do with those funds that they get through insured deposits @!AUG Let 's go over for a minute to what you need in terms of money . The administration is asking for - what ? - $70 billion in borrowing authority . Henry Gonzalez of the House Banking Committee says , \" Well , we 're ready to give $25 billion . \" What do you really need ? Would $25 billion be enough ? Mr. SEIDMAN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has asked to cover potential losses . The rest of the money that we 're talking about is money that we borrow short term to carry the assets that we take out of bad banks till we sell those assets . When we sell them , we pay that money back . So those are not losses . That 's just what we call working capital . So $25 billion is the right number in terms of what we need to cover any potential losses that anybody has predicted @!VANOCUR Mr. Chairman , what 's wrong with borrowing that money from the Fed ? Mr. SEIDMAN : Well , I do n't think there 's anything wrong . I 'd be happy to borrow it from the Fed . However , Chairman Greenspan and the governors think that it would be a bad precedent . We really do n't care . We 'll borrow it wherever we can get the best rate @!VANOCUR Thanks very much for joining us once again on Business World . And when we come back , when health-care costs go up and insurance benefits go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VANOCUR : Turning to the week on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell , the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week down by more than 53 points . Last week , our panel of stock market experts from around the country predicted a down week . Our panels ' consensus is for another down week ahead . Panelist Robert Farrell , chief technical analyst for Merrill Lynch , thinks there will be more action on the Street as companies try to get rid of debt . ROBERT FARRELL , Technical Analyst : There was so much debt that was put on corporate bond sheets in the 1980s that everytime the market does get better , corporations are going to try to raise funds by selling equity to pay off that debt . And we do see a very big calender this quarter . My guess is that 's one of the things that will contribute to the market being at a- at least a point where it 's going to have to take a rest @!VANOCUR The price of health care has been skyrocketing and the administration 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise from more than 12 percent of the gross national product today to 17 percent by the year 2000 and a staggering 37 percent by 2030 . For working people , it means almost certainly having to pay more of the bill themselves . And that may be true even for those who think they know how to control costs . DAVE RAHILL , Foster Higgins : \" Mirror , mirror on the wall , who 's the fairest one of all ? \" VANOCUR : voice-over Even if you answer \" baby Allison , \" the bill for her normal birth was n't attractive to the Rahills . It cost almost $10,000 . Mr. RAHILL : We knew it would be a large bill , but I guess a couple of things took us a little bit by surprise @!VANOCUR voice-over But you 'd think that Dave Rahill , who advises corporations on how to hold down medical costs , would have been able to keep his own costs down . Mr. RAHILL : My wife asked me to talk to the doctor because she felt I was the expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a full sense of confidence negotiating the birth of my daughter with our physician @!VANOCUR voice-over Confronting doctors about their bills is one of the main tactics that companies are telling their employees to use in an effort to hold down costs . Despite Rahill talking the doctor out of doing additional tests that would have added another $500 , the family 's portion of the cost of Allison 's birth was 60 percent higher than the cost of their first child , born in the same suburban hospital four years earlier . What happened to the Rahills is typical of what is happening to families across the country . In the last five years , employers have increasingly shifted more medical costs to employees through higher premiums , larger deductibles and copayments . Dr. ROGER TAYLOR , Wyatt Consulting : In 1990 , if you take an employee with a family , they paid about $1 for every $2 that they employer paid in health-care cost . That 's , essentially , a one-to-two ratio , and that 's about double what was happening in 1985 @!VANOCUR voice-over Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage , as a percentage of compensation , the cost has shot up from eight percent in 1987 to an expected 14.5 percent in 1993 . While 61 percent of companies paid the total cost of health insurance for their employees and dependents in 1987 , only 43 percent do so now . Employees and their dependents are being caught in a squeeze between coverage and cost . DAVID WALKER , Arthur Anderson &amp; Company : I think people are going to have to make decisions . There 's no question about it . They 're going to have to make decisions as to the level of coverage that they want and they can afford @!VANOCUR voice-over Not only are their premiums higher , but insurance companies are limiting the amount they will pay for a procedure , leaving employees to negotiate with their doctors or be liable for the balance.Prof . UWE REINHARDT , Princeton University : You really do n't know what a medical procedure will cost you , because you do n't know how much , in addition to the insurance carrier 's allowed fee , the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurance carrier 's allowed fee is , so it 's a very strange system @!VANOCUR voice-over Even Rahill , who knows how the system works , got a firsthand lesson when he took his daughter to the orthopedist . Mr. RAHILL : His charge for what was termed an initial , comprehensive exam was $125 . That turned out to be $25 higher than what our insurance company recognized as a reasonable , prevailing fee . We then got reimbursed for 80 percent of the reasonable fee . We got reimbursed $80 , so we had to pay not just 20 percent of the fee , but we wound up paying almost 45 percent of the fee @!VANOCUR When we return , healthy growth in one segment of the computer industry , where little things mean a lot . Commercial break VANOCUR : The computer industry , especially hardware makers like IBM , have been hard hit by the recession . Even Wall Street darling Compaq took a beating this week when its quarterly earnings were less than analysts projected . But one segment of the industry is behaving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , at least in this business , good things really do come in small packages . STEVEN FRANCIS , Service Representative : And how much could you pay per month on the balance in addition to the new bills as they come out ? CUSTOMER : Fifty dollars a month @!VANOCUR voice-over At New York 's Brooklyn Union Gas Company , service representatives use a handheld organizer made by Sharp to figure out whether customers qualify for credit . Mr. FRANCIS : The customer actually sees us . We 're asking questions . We 're keying information into our Wizards . They know we 're not just coming off-the-cuff with these questions @!VANOCUR voice- over Handheld organizers and computers are the cutting edge of portable technology , even though they had been categorized as executive toys , primarily used for keeping track of phone numbers and appointments . ANDREW SEYBOLD , Dataquest : I expect to see this type of box become a miniature terminal for electronic mail , for- through MCI Mail , through lots of the mail services and , also , to get back to my desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I 've been away @!VANOCUR voice-over And the technology will be even more portable when Motorola ties a pager to Hewlett Packard 's new handheld computer . Executives on the go like the new technology because it means carrying a few ounces worth of palm-top computer instead of five to 15 pounds of portable computer . And corporations like Prudential Insurance are buying thousands of Sharp Wizards for sales forces because , at $400 a pop , they 're comparatively cheap and because they do n't require computer literacy . GIL DeLISO , Marketing Manager , Sharp : It allows the sales person in the field to be more efficient in terms of presenting the product and closing the sales . MARK EPPLEY , CEO , Traveling Software : We 're kind of at the beginning of a revolution in portable computing . In essence , this is a concept that we 've discussed in our company and we believe in . It 's called the \" extended office . \" VANOCUR : voice-over The burgeoning market for palm- top computers is being made possible by miniaturized hardware and portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways : hooking your handheld to your desktop with products like those from Nictrix , Intellilink and Traveling Software ; or you can use memory cards with commercial software , like these , made to run on the pocket PC ; or , finally , you can use special drives to write your programs to blank memory cards , like Flash Memory , made by Intel , which can hold as much information as a box of floppy disks , but at a still hefty price , more than $700 . The cards also run on the newly announced Hewlett Packard 95LX , a product designed jointly by HP and software maker Lotus . JOHN YOUNG , CEO , Hewlett Packard : It 's a machine that 's , I think , targeted , certainly , as a key user base , Lotus 1-2-3 users and there 's 14 million of those around out of the 60 million PC owners today , so it 's a big subset of the overall marketplace @!VANOCUR voice-over The 11-ounce , $700 machine comes with more memory already built in than was available on early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , the Poqet PC , an American-made computer , was the first handheld to use industry-standard programs and while it has n't been a big success so far , the company , now part of Fujitsu , says new models are on the way . BOW RODGERS , Executive Vice President , Poqet Computer : Pocket 2 is 1991 situation , which is a refinement , improvement , an updating , in our opinion , of the products that we have right now , the product we have right now . But a revolutionary jump , not an evolutionary jump , is in 1992 @!VANOCUR voice-over Even though handheld computers have been around for several years , analysts say that because of software , the field is poised to take off . Mr. SEYBOLD : In 1991 , you 're talking non-Casio , non-Sharp sales in excess of 500,000 units . I 'm talking about the Hewlett Packard and Poqet genre type of equipment , with Sharp and Casio selling an equal number in their own niches @!VANOCUR The one major limitation still facing these computers is n't in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human fingers . They 're just too big to do any serious typing . When we come back , this week 's winners and losers . Commercial break VANOCUR : Finally , this week 's winners and losers depends on whether you 're a boss or a worker . According to a survey by Business Week magazine at the nation 's 500 largest companies , average CEO salaries and bonuses climbed seven percent in 1990 to $1,953,000 , while corporate profits dropped by seven percent . Over the decade of the ' 80s , while factory worker compensation rose 53 percent , executive compensation was up 212 percent . That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Sander Vanocur . On behalf of everyone here at Business World , thanks for being with us. \r\n##223878 @!STEPHEN-AUG : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Stephen Aug and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice-over Cities in trouble : Bridgeport files for bankruptcy . Will other municipalities follow suit ? And what happens to the municipal bond market if they do ? From Washington , this week 's Business World guest , Gerald McEntee , head of the nation 's largest public employees ' union . And computer confusion in standards : if you 're sitting in front of a computer screen , do terms like DOS 5 , OS/2 and Windows 3 mean anything more than just techno-babble ? And computer animation comes to commercials . Will award-winning , high-tech whimsy sell products any better than real actors ? ANNOUNCER : From ABC News , this is Business World , with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , sitting in for the vacationing Sander Vanocur , here 's Stephen Aug @!AUG Cities in crisis . The recession is hitting home in dozens of states and hundreds of cities and it 's worst in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up . That 's meant less revenue and more social services demands . The sum total ; a fiscal disaster which , late in the week , claimed its first major casualty , Bridgeport , Connecticut . While Bridgeport may stand alone as the first into bankruptcy court , it 's got lots of company trying to swim upstream against the tide of red ink . Thursday 1st PRO-LABOR DEMONSTRATOR : Cut management back ! Do n't lay off the workforce ! That 's what we have to do . 2nd PRO-LABOR DEMONSTRATOR : Eleven hundred workers and keep 300 outside political hacks . That 's bad business ! AUG : voice-over Hundreds of New York City park workers rallied to protect their jobs in the face of proposed cuts that would lay off fully one third of them . Still , that 's only part of New York Mayor David Dinkins ' plan to eliminate a $3.5 billion deficit from the city 's proposed $28.7 billion budget . Dinkins would eliminate 8,000 jobs over the next three weeks and possibly as many as 27,000 in the months ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 8,1991 ) We must not simply succumb to our plight . We can do something about it @!AUG voice-over New York 's problems are just one example of the financial angst afflicting American state and local governments . In California , the state government is faced with a deficit topping $14 billion . PETE WILSON , Governor of California : ( March 29,1991 ) We can pray for a May miracle in terms of revenue recovery , but it 's very clear we can not rely upon hope and it 's very clear that we can not wait @!AUG voice-over Unfortunately for Wilson , the May miracle did not occur . State tax revenues have now fallen each month for the first five months of this year . In Los Angeles , the state 's biggest city , they 're planning to cut 445 police jobs through attrition to help trim an expected $177-million city deficit . TOM BRADLEY , Mayor of Los Angeles : The steps which we 've taken are almost Draconian , but we simply ca n't go beyond that @!AUG voice-over In Maine , the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furloughs were ordered in Rhode Island and Suffolk County , New York . Then , last week , Bridgeport , Connecticut , became the biggest American city in generations to seek bankruptcy court protection . MARY MORAN , Mayor of Bridgeport : We have a problem . We have to get off the merry-go-round . We have to say , \" We have a problem , \" and we have to do something about it . That 's what we 're doing @!AUG voice-over But in the credit markets , the Bridgeport bankruptcy caused not even a ripple , possibly because about half the bonds are privately insured . And earlier in the week , New York City was able to sell $675 million worth of bonds , but the city had to pay a relatively high 8.5 percent interest rate to attract buyers . FELIX ROHATYN , Chairman , Municipal Assistance Corporation : The reality of life is that the city 's bonds are selling as if they carried a lower rating than that provided by Standard &amp; Poor 's @!AUG voice-over Rohatyn was instrumental in helping New York through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , this time , conditions are worse and he 's not alone . Prof. RAYMOND HORTON , Columbia Business School : New York City is still able to borrow money in the public credit markets . If it loses the ability to access the public credit markets , then things will be much worse . ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN , New York City Comptroller : Now , of course , the city ca n't rely on the federal government . The federal government has , over the past 12 years , been pulling the rugs- the rugs out from all the cities in this country @!AUG voice-over Twenty one states have budget trouble . California , Connecticut , Louisiana , Maine , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New York , Pennsylvania , Vermont and Virginia are the worst , with deficits amounting to more than 15 percent of their budgets . There is no one reason why all these states got into trouble . MARCIA HOWARD , Association of State Budget Officers : If you look , particularly , around 1986- ' 87 , you 'll see that several states cut taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , many states were , as you say , implementing programs that used much of the surpluses that they were generating during those years , and those programs are now causing problems in the state budgets @!AUG voice-over Add on 10 years ' worth of billions of dollars in federal aid cutbacks , the AIDS epidemic , the crack invasion and growing homelessness , and the final straw was the recession . But some say politicians must share the blame for overspending , hiring too many people , far more than the growth in population . DANIEL MITCHELL , Economist , The Heritage Foundation : If you look at a state like New York , you have a 30 percent growth in public employees since 1980 , when you only had a two percent increase in the population and I think that there 's no way you can justify that we had much more government needs today as opposed to 1980 @!AUG voice-over To solve their problems , state and local governments are looking at raising college tuitions , cutting back Medicaid where they can and raising taxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's supposed to help . Mr. MITCHELL : A state that raises taxes is going to lose taxpayers and businesses to a neighboring state @!AUG voice-over And there are nationwide effects . Mr. ROHATYN : Government cutbacks and tax increases , in order to close these deficits , that , in my judgment , are going to be the equivalent of , say , a $50-billion tax increase across the country and coming on top of a very weak economy , which might be trying to turn its head up a little bit , I think it 's going to be very negative @!AUG It 's worth noting that public employee unions are , by far , the fastest growing labor unions and while only 12 percent of workers in private industry are union members , 37 percent of public employees are . By the turn of the century , the public sector unions could account for 60 to 70 percent of all trade union members . In a minute , will city workers offer the kind of give-backs that industrial unions gave to bail out corporations ? We 'll ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUG : In Rhode Island , state workers have agreed to take some unpaid work days as a means of helping ease the state 's fiscal crisis , but in New York City , after getting new contracts , municipal unions have been reluctant to help . As head of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , this week 's Business World guest faces the question , \" What should public workers do to help their fiscally strapped employers ? \" Gerald McEntee joins us from our studios in Washington . Mr. McEntee , I guess that- why do n't we start with that ? What should public employees be doing to help the city ? GERALD McENTEE , President , AFSCME : Well , I think public sector workers and public employees , whether they work in a city or a state , are willing to come forward and attempt to help the cities and states . I mean , we 've been through this before @!AUG Yeah , but , in fact , they really have n't been willing to come forward this time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , to take days off was because the government was shutting down the state for one day a week . Is n't that right ? Mr. McENTEE : Well , we reached agreement in the State of Rhode Island , because of the problems , to help the governor meet the fiscal crisis facing Rhode Island . But go back to the ' 70s . We were the union that , really , bailed out New York City . We did it with Detroit . We did it with Philadelphia . Our people have always been ready to come forward to help fiscally strapped cities and states . We 're ready to do it in New York City , but we have yet to see a major , overall plan to bring the city out of the fiscal crisis that now exists @!AUG All right , now- Mr. McENTEE : You see pieces of it , but we 've yet to see an overall plan @!AUG In the ' 70s , one way you helped New York City was , as I recall , your pension plan bought Big Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with them . I mean , they were a fine investment . This time around , it 's like a private employer . When the steel industry got into trouble , the workers were forced , practically , to make givebacks . The same in the automobile industry . But , for some reason , the public employees are not willing to do this . They say , \" We 're not going to do it . \" How do you say you 're helping them ? Mr. McENTEE : Well , we do say we 're helping them . Our people go to the negotiating table and if a case is made by the management of that particular state and the city , our people have been ready , willing and able to meet that kind of problem . One of the problems is that people talk about this \" growth \" in the public sector and the growth of public employees . And we would like people to take an awfully close and real look at what kind of growth we 've had @!AUG All right , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I may , you mentioned the City of New York and we have seen growth in the last decade , 62 percent in management and very little growth - up around 15 or 20 percent , if that - in the people who actually perform the work , collecting the garbage and keeping the bridges in repair @!AUG All right , so your argument , then , is if you 're going to cut the workers , you certainly better cut the management . Mr. McENTEE : Well , you most certainly have to take a hard look at bloated management that now exists in so many states and so many cities @!AUG All right . One way to solve that problem would be privatization . Let 's take garbage collection . You privatize the garbage collection , you get rid of , practically , the whole sanitation department and it becomes cheaper . Is n't that a good idea ? Mr. McENTEE : Well , you 'd get rid of the sanitation department . You would n't get rid of the managers . We 've had experiences with sanitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high degree of management . We 've seen , after a period of time of one or two years , the cost of even the private sector being in excess of the public sector . They will lowball in order to get their first contract in , but once it 's in and the city or the state 's rid of the equipment , then they can really call the shots . In addition , we have seen the private sector , particularly in the defense department of the federal government , take over in terms of weapons and equipment and things like that , and that 's probably been one of the greatest scandals that we 've had , in terms of federal government and private sector , in the history of this country @!AUG All right . I 'm sorry . We 're out of time , Mr. McEntee , but thanks very much for being with us . When we come back , when is a standard not a standard ? When it 's set by the computer industry . Commercial break AUG : Turning to the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dow Jones Industrial average finished the week down by almost 51 points . Last week , our panel of stock market experts from around the country predicted an up week . Our panel 's consensus is for a down week ahead . Panelist Lou Holland of Chicago-based Holland Capital Management says stocks may look less attractive than bonds , for the moment . LOU HOLLAND , Investment Advisor : I think we 're still in the bull market . The problem is that stocks are not particularly cheap , selling at about 18 times earnings , yielding around three percent , in an environment where bonds are yielding almost 8.5 percent . However , in the second half of the year , I do think that the dollar will continue to be strong and I think interest rates , again , will begin to come down and I think , in that kind of environment , you 're going to see a continuation of the bull market @!AUG On Friday came word that traditional rivals Apple and IBM are talking about exchanging technology , just the latest effort by high-tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been joint announcements by a host of companies , ostensibly to set standards to make computers easier to use and buying decisions easier to make . The result , however , can be just the reverse . voice-over DOS 5 , OS/2-2 , OS/2-3 , Windows 3 , RISK , SISK , 286 , 386 , 486 - it may sound like techno-babble , but it 's the computer industry 's buzzwords for pieces of hardware and software , competing to become standards for users of the nation 's 57 million personal computers . GLEN HANEY , CEO , DataQuest : IBM has set the standards for the industry for such a long time and has disadvantaged so many companies thereby that people area always in the mode of wanting to establish some new standards that are more amenable to their interest and to their hardware and their technology @!AUG voice-over Now , IBM is being challenged as the hardware leader by hundreds of clones and IBM is playing challenger to Microsoft , a company it helped make successful in the battle over operating systems . But the set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean little more than confusion for computer users . JIM MANZI , CEO , Lotus Development : To us , and I think to users , generally , the operating system is plumbing . What the user wants is water and that comes at the application level , so our objective is the companies that deliver water , regardless of what the plumbing is @!AUG voice-over But the cost of upgrading that plumbing , be it hardware or software , is n't just esoteric . It 's expensive . SHELDON LAUBE , Director of Technology , Price Waterhouse : The switching of an operating system in an organization like ours with over 10,000 personal computers is a major undertaking . It 's not one we 'd like to do a few times a year . We do n't even want to do it every two or three years , AUG : voice-over Laube estimates that for every $100 Price Waterhouse spends on a new software package , it costs two to three times that much in training and support . To upgrade hardware from older 286 machines to faster 386 machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $5,000 to $6,000 per computer , including installation . And after installing 6,000 copies of Microsoft 's Windows , now , Price Waterhouse is waiting for the release of IBM 's new operating system , due out later this year , which may mean doing it all over again . While Windows has helped boost sales of programs that are more user friendly , critics say it 's slow and still based on Microsoft 's original PC operating system , known as DOS , built for machines with far less capabilities than today 's . Up till now , the competition has largely been Microsoft versus Microsoft . Over the past year , the company shipped 18 million copies of DOS and four million copies of Windows 3 , but IBM and Microsoft together sold only 400,000 copies of OS/2 . BILL GATES , CEO , Microsoft : We 've seen what the market 's done , which is overwhelmingly buy Windows , and so Microsoft is responding to that . We 're listening to that and IBM 's position has n't changed at all , based on customers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quandary . Do they upgrade operating systems and applications packages now or do they wait for the next promised model , which may still be , in industry jargon , \" vapor ware \" ? BILL MACHRONE , Editor-In- Chief , \" PC \" Magazine : Do I stick with Excel on this platform or do I wait for Lotus to bring out 1-2-3-4 Windows ? So there 's this waiting game . There 's no solution for it @!AUG voice-over But customers are not laying down and playing dead . An increasing number have formed user groups , many working with British-based X/Open Company to get manufacturers to overcome industry politics and agree to a set of customer-endorsed standards . GEOFF MORRIS , CEO , X/Open : As long as the buyer remains in charge of compatibility in these specifications and drives these specifications and states the priorities and his needs and the suppliers meet those needs , then any politics will evaporate @!AUG voice-over And what about hardware ? In order to get the most out of Windows and Windows programs , hardware makers are pushing faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 486 chips . While the new computer programs have allowed software makers to largely ignore the recession , that has not been the case for hardware makers , with some , like Compaq , Apple and even IBM , suffering downturns in stock prices after poor earnings reports . LUCIANNE PAINTER , Analyst , Salomon Brothers : I think the hardware industry and the software industry are really exhibiting opposite results and I think that will continue , especially in recessionary times @!AUG voice-over And stay tuned . There are still more standards debates on the way over even newer operating systems and even more powerful hardware . on camera And to prove the point , on Tuesday , Microsoft unveils the fifth generation of DOS . When we return , one application of computer technology with something to sell . Commercial break AUG : If you watch television , you watch commercials ; at least , we hope you watch commercials , since that 's what pays the rent . But , as ABC News correspondent Ken Prewitt reports , many commercials are being done with computer animation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's real or Memorex . KEN PREWITT , ABC News : voice-over It 's cute , charming , Academy Award-winning , but can computer animation sell products ? Lifesavers test market experience says yes . CHERYL BACHELDER , Vice President , Marketing , Planters/Lifesavers : We achieved a 14 percent share of market in our test market for Lifesavers holes and that was well above our expectations , probably about a third above our expectations @!PREWITT voice-over To introduce a new product , Planters/Lifesavers wanted a new technique with enough character and color to cut through the clutter . RALPH GUGGENHEIM , Executive Producer , Pixar : You 're seeing things that look very dimensional ; they occupy space ; they reflect life and they move in a very realistic manner and yet , at the same time , they do things that no one would ever expect to see - when a bottle was portrayed as a boxer or when lifesavers ride skateboards @!PREWITT voice-over The Lifesavers commercial , developed for cartoon-watching kids , unexpectedly wowed the grown-ups . Ms. BACHELDER : Beating our expectations on important measures like purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product after they see the commercial . It 's one of the strongest commercials we 've ever produced @!PREWITT voice-over Faster computers with better software have brought down costs from an estimated $600,000 for a 30-second spot five years ago to about a third of that today . BERNIE OWETT , Creative Director , J. Walter Thompson : I do n't naturally gravitate toward computers or machines . It 's incredible , but in the last three or four years , the bulk of my work has had either total computer animation or pieces of it @!PREWITT voice-over Another advantage , a character already built and stored in the computer costs less when used again in a campaign . TOM KENNEDY , Executive Producer , Industrial Light and Magic : We can create a character that has life long after the first commercial airs and there 's an initial investment in computer modeling , so you can amortize that cost through a campaign where you bring that character back @!PREWITT voice-over Computer animation has meant visible growth for companies like Rhythm and Hues , whose earnings have risen from about $1.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but computer animation is n't always that visible . JOHN HUGHES , President , Rhythm and Hues : It 's almost like a chameleon , also , in that you can imitate anything . You can make it look like cell animation . You can make it look like clay animation . You can make it look almost photo-real @!PREWITT voice-over In some cases , computer- generated images , known as CGI , are replacing stop-motion or being used to create a set or to perform special effects . ANTHONY VAGNONI , Editor , \" Advertising Age \" : When you see it in those circumstances - the bear into the bull or the melting football players for Diet Coke - you wo n't necessary know it 's CGI . There 's a whole body of effects work that 's created to be not noticed . It 's called seamless effects @!PREWITT voice-over Advances in technology are bringing more companies into the field and making the technique more accessible to more advertisers . But the real breakthrough may be yet to come . Mr. VAGNONI : There has n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We seem to be able to relate better to cartoons , hand-drawn cartoon like Bugs Bunny than we can to computer-generated cartoons , but who knows ? Someone may come up with the Daffy Duck of CGI and rewrite everything @!AUG We 'll be back with a final word . Commercial break AUG : And , finally , a look at one of this week 's winners and losers . The winner , Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca . Despite his company 's financial problems , Chrysler has decided to buy his Florida oceanfront condo for almost $800,000 after already having bought his Michigan home for just over $900,000 . The company says the purchases will let Iacocca concentrate on Chrysler business . And he may need to do just that , because Chrysler was also this week 's loser , as both Standard &amp; Poor 's and Moody 's downgraded Chrysler bonds because of its huge losses . That 's it for this week . Whatever business you 're in , we hope the week ahead is a prosperous one . I 'm Stephen Aug . On behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks for being with us. \r\n##223879 @!SANDER-VANOCUR : Welcome to Business World . I 'm Sander Vanocur and here 's what 's on this week 's agenda . voice over Scandal at Salomon Brothers , the largest government securities trader . Heads are already rolling . Can super-investor Warren Buffet save Salomon from the fate of Drexel ? We 'll ask this week 's Business World guest from Pickwick Lake , Tennessee , Ralph Horn , chairman of the Public Securities Association . And the Hollywood entertainment machine . Is Arnold Schwarzenegger strong enough to terminate the industry flow of red ink ? Also , a new way to chart the music at the top of the charts , and Big Bertha , the driving force in golf clubs , giving players more bang for the buck @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News , this is Business World with Sander Vanocur and Stephen Aug . Now , from New York , here 's Sander Vanocur @!VANOCUR The special board meeting being held today by Salomon , Inc. , parent of Salomon Brothers , may be anticlimactic. voice-over All day Friday , the players on Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that longtime chairman John Gutfreund , the man featured in the best-seller Liar 's Poker , was folding his last hand , turning in his resignation . In place of the ultimate trader Gutfreund , the ultimate investor , Warren Buffet , a man with almost mythical savvy , is expected to take over as chairman and CEO , all this after admission that the trading desk at Salomon broke rules on at least three different occasions on buying government securities and that the men at the top knew but did n't tell . on camera Salomon is the grandaddy of the 40 so- called \" primary dealers \" in government securities , and even though government agencies now involved in the Salomon investigation say the change in management will buy some time , there could still be civil and criminal charges , fines and other sanctions . But the government finds itself in a very awkward position . Government securities have been one of the least regulated areas in the business because the Federal Reserve and the Treasury , which sell the securities , also regulate the dealers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry , we turn to this week 's Business World guest , head of the association that represents government bond dealers , the Public Securities Association , Ralph Horn , who joins us from Pickwick Lake , Tennessee . Mr. Horn , in the matter of Salomon Brothers , was this a lack of government regulation or a breakdown of rules by Salomon ? RALPH HORN , Chairman , Public Securities Association : It seems to be much more of a breakdown of rules by one of the participants , as far as we can see @!VANOCUR Well , look , we 've gone through an awful lot in the last five years in areas besides government securities , and will the public not be asking for who 's in charge ? Mr. HORN : Well , obviously , this is the largest and the most liquid market in the world , and the investors do need to have the confidence that the rules that are in place are being adhered to , so there are rules in place . The Fed and the Treasury do the monitoring of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there are- the rules there are in place where these types of infractions can be dealt with @!VANOCUR But , sir , in the area of financial instruments , has n't the market in which you work been dependent upon word and honor ? Mr. HORN : That is correct , but , again , as I state , this is such a huge marketplace and there are so many participants that looking at what the market 's done over the last two or three days would n't indicate that there is any lack of confidence that has showed up @!VANOCUR Well , is this going to hurt people like you ? Mr. HORN : It should n't . Again , there are 40 primary dealers . There are hundreds of dealer banks and bond- that have bond divisions . There are non-bank dealers all over the country that bid and trade in these securities every day and distribute those securities , so it 's such a huge market , having an infraction by one participant I do n't think will have a negative effect on the marketplace or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!VANOCUR But , sir , it 's more than one participant . This is the biggest participant . You 're now talking about an area which involves that phrase \" the full faith and credit of the U.S. government . \" Should n't investors have some qualms now ? Mr. HORN : Well , I think we need to wait and see how this plays out , Sandy , because the rules are in place and the investigation is ongoing and the PSA believes that those rules should be adhered to and we should have full enforcement if there are any aberrations or violations of those rules , so , as this is playing out , I guess the most obvious thing , if those rules were n't in place , then I would n't be sitting here talking with you today @!VANOCUR But if the rules were in place and it took all this time to find out , does n't that suggest the rules may be okay , but the enforcement may be lax ? Mr. HORN : Well , I think we 'll have to wait and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how long the investigation has been going on and to what extent it 's been going on - what we 're hearing now @!VANOCUR Well , I 'm not trying to get you to point a finger , but if the Congress comes back and in the securities bill revision that 's now going on , says there ought to be greater regulation in this least regulated area , what would be the position of your association ? Mr. HORN : Well , the association has been very much involved in the reauthorization of the government Securities Act , and that act deals mostly in the secondary market , and these infractions involve the bidding at auction in the primary market , so , to this point , the Senate Banking Subcommittee that marked up a bill two or three weeks ago dealt with the secondary market and talked about some sales practice guidelines - this , on the other hand , hopefully is an isolated incident - and it dealt with the auction process where the securities were being purchased from the U.S. Treasury , rather than the selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I think there is a major distinction there @!VANOCUR Thank you very much . Thanks for joining us from Pickwick Lake . In a minute , Hollywood , where moviemakers are suffering from a nearly industry-wide summer cold . Commercial break VANOCUR : Turning to the week on Wall Street , at Friday 's closing bell , the Dow Jones Industrial average finished the week down by more than 28 points , just as our panel of stock market experts from around the country had predicted . Our panel 's consensus is for another down week ahead . Panelist Robert Farrell , chief market analyst for Merrill Lynch , says the up-and-down economic figures could have an impact on the market . ROBERT FARRELL , Chief Market Analyst : I think we 're in this crucial stage now where the stock market has assumed that the economy is going to do better , so that if it does n't show better signs of improvement soon , I think the stock market can have a letdown . That might mean that as we go into the fall , it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose performance has been less than meteoric in recent weeks are movies . Independent production companies in particular have suffered , as their products have languished at the box office . The big studios have also failed to come up with much that made for a boffo box office , with at least one notable exception . voice-over The smash hit of the season , Terminator 2 , continues to annihilate the competition at the box office . Made by Carolco Pictures , it 's distributed by Tristar , a unit of Sony 's Columbia Pictures . MIKE MEDAVOY , Chairman , Tristar Pictures : It is a move that 's going to play worldwide , probably do in the neighborhood of $400 million just in the theatrical side of it . ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER , Actor : \" Terminator 2 , \" Tristar Pictures Hasta la vista , baby @!VANOCUR voice-over Yet even the terminator ca n't blow away the shaky economics behind the world of make-believe . Ticket sales are declining and box office revenues are flat . Meanwhile , movie production costs are up 33 percent since 1987 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture now costs $38 million . JOE ROTH , Chairman , Twentieth Century Fox : It is the most burdensome part of this job , is the constant pressure of the cost of movies , the cost of advertising , the cost of actors , the cost of writers , and with lowering admissions , the graph does n't really pan out @!VANOCUR voice- over Legendary Hollywood agent Irving Lazar sees problems . IRVING LAZAR , Agent : If you want to make that movie with Schwarzenegger , who gets perhaps $15 million alone as his fee- if you want to make that kind of movie , that 's what it 's going to cost . In point of fact , it 's a gamble which should rarely be taken @!VANOCUR voice-over One example , Tristar 's early summer release Hudson Hawk cost $50 million to make , including $5 million for star Bruce Willis . Panned by critics , it quickly became the biggest box office disaster in years . BRUCE WILLIS , Actor : \" Hudson Hawk , \" Tristar Pictures One-800- I 'm gon na die ! VANOCUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from future budget busters . At the old Columbia lot , now named Sony Studios , a $50 million Stephen Spielberg version of Peter Pan is being shot . Mr. MEDAVOY : I do n't think there 's any rules in this business . You make movies that you think are going to have broad appeal , and sometimes they 'll work and sometimes they wo n't @!VANOCUR voice-over One reason for such bravado , the enormous growth of home video . Domestic home video wholesale revenue is about $4 billion , versus box office revenues that are just under $2.5 billion net to studios . Then there 's the explosion is foreign sales . Mr. MEDAVOY : I would say now , for example , 50 percent of the revenues that come into the motion picture business , or the entertainment business , per se , in the motion picture company comes out of the foreign markets , and it becomes a very important part of it @!VANOCUR voice- over Unfortunately , not all of the studios have learned how to capitalize on the global market . Despite the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in financial trouble . JESSICA REIF , Analyst , Oppenheimer &amp; Company : Dances With Wolves , which was one of their top-grossing films in the U.S.- Orion sold the international distribution rights , so they were not able to benefit from the success that they had in the States @!VANOCUR voice- over Even Kevin Costner may not get paid . JERRY KATZMAN , President , William Morris Agency : I do n't know , and I do n't think anybody knows yet , what Kevin Costner will see from that movie @!VANOCUR voice-over Now , ironically , a scene from Orion 's latest release where Bill and Ted try to outwit the Grim Reaper could be a parable about its own fate , without the Hollywood ending . In the meantime , the whole industry seemed to have geared up production just as the so-called ancillary markets have turned soft . Ms. REIF : You know , ancillary markets are important , but they are not growing , and I think that 's critical @!VANOCUR voice-over Fox 's Joe Roth , who backed Home Alone , last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks too many movies are being made . Mr. ROTH : The poor American consumer has to choose between five or six new movies every single weekend , and so , unfortunately , when those movies die , they 're not really worth what somebody who ran numbers thought they were worth when it comes time to putting them on television in Germany or on video in Japan @!VANOCUR voice- over And it 's not just quantity , but also a lack of quality that 's hurting business . Robert Towne , who wrote the screenplay for Chinatown , says a growing corporate mentality at the studios is stifling creativity . ROBERT TOWNE , Scriptwriter : Most writers are not in any position to defend their material against a conglomerate , the phalanx of executives that for months and months go over a script expressing all of their wishes @!VANOCUR voice-over More bad news for the big studios , the top-grossing movies this season were made by so-called independents . Castle Rock 's City Slickers has done over $100 million , Carolco 's Terminator 2 , over $160 million , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They keep the lion 's share of the profits . The studios only get a distribution fee . These newcomers also know how to maximize the international market . JAMES ROBINSON , Chairman , Morgan Creek : Robin Hood is a story which virtually every country in the world that would be one of our markets- they know the story @!VANOCUR voice-over And Robinson , a former car distributor , held on to the foreign rights to his picture , unlike Orion , which pre-sold Dances With Wolves . Mr. ROBINSON : What we chose to do was not to take any advances and , basically , if you will , take the risk , but if the film played , as they say , we 'd get to keep all the money , and it did play and we get to keep all the money @!VANOCUR And on the subject of being on-target , when we come back , a look at a new way of measuring music sales that some critics say is hitting a sour note . Commercial break VANOCUR : If you listen to most radio stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll hear something about the Billboard ratings . It 's the chart that 's at the top of the charts in the multi-billion dollar music business , where ratings not only reflect sales , they help boost them as well . That 's why when Billboard decided to change the way it measures popularity , it set the record world spinning . voice-over A lot of rappers and country artists are riding high on Billboard 's pop album chart . That 's proof , says the 97-year-old publication , that its new ratings system , based on actual sales figures , has lofty implications . TIMOTHY WHITE , Editor-In-Chief , \" Billboard \" Magazine : What we 're seeing now is sort of the dawn of a new era of democracy in terms of the pop album charts , because a sale , a purchase , is a vote @!VANOCUR voice-over Billboard began printing the charts in May , after what it calls \" a long mating dance \" with Soundscan , a small , New York- based company that 's been buying computerized sales data , sometimes exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soundscan : The charts were really a byproduct . We felt that the real advantage to our system to the record industry was the information that allowed them to operate in a more profitable nature that would lead to the bottom line @!VANOCUR voice- over For example , he says sales of Natalie Cole 's number-one album can be broken down to see how many copies are being sold and where they 're being sold . Reportedly , Soundscan expects about $800,000 from each of the six major labels for its data . Sony , the first to sign on , says it will help with promotion . PAUL SMITH , President , Sony Music : If the artist goes into several venues and nothing happens as a result , no records sell , then maybe that 's the time to cut that tour short @!VANOCUR voice-over And , he adds , accurate data will help minimize returns in what is still largely a consignment industry . But how accurate is the data ? Not all industry insiders are singing Soundscan 's praises . The company says its sample , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales per week , is certainly better than the previous system , which relied on employee estimates and was susceptible to hype and human bias . MICHAEL SHALETT , Chief Operating Officer , Soundscan : Music that previously had been directed only to genre-specific charts - black , classical , country , et cetera - all of a sudden showed up as being more popular . I think immediately , the industry reacted and said , \" There might be something wrong with the sample . \" VANOCUR : voice-over But MCA says Billboard acted too soon . RICHARD PALMESE , President , MCA Records : Currently , the Soundscan system does not represent accurate sales of records across the country . Their chart , which is compiled for Billboard , represents less than 50 percent of records sold , and that 's a problem @!VANOCUR voice-over One problem , it omits an industry giant , Tower Records , which may put certain artists at a disadvantage , and while most of the titles on Tower 's top list are similarly positioned in Soundscan 's chart , there are some glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is number 164 on the charts . The retailer feels alternative artists will have a rough time . STAN GORMAN , Senior Vice President , Tower Records : The accounts that are signed up to Soundscan wo n't carry them until they 're hot . We 're not signed up to Soundscan , and in the case of groups like The Bulgarian Voices , which was one of our top sellers for a long time , I do n't think it would make the charts now @!VANOCUR voice-over Tower says it 's not withholding information . It 's just an analog company in a digital world , although computerization is in the works . Even so , Tower says , judging what 's hot in the music business should be more than a matter of counting sales , but Soundscan is banking on others to disagree and see its data as precisely the tune needed to bring the industry up-to-date . Mr. FINE : Record manufacturers now can use that information to do what all other industries do . They can test market ; they can do advertising control . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we return , a new club becomes the driving force in golf . Commercial break VANOCUR : The golf world was stunned a week ago when a new sports hero from Arkansas drove his way onto the American scene . John Daly won his first golf tournament in a big way , winning the PGA Championship tournament with a soft touch on the greens and Jolly Green Giant drives off the tees . voice-over Every golfers ' dream , whether a pro or a president , is to hit the ball farther and straighter off the tee than ever before , and sometimes a new golf club will help . Pres. GEORGE BUSH : I never got off the tee so well in my life @!VANOCUR voice-over The President 's new driver is named Big Bertha , a wide-bodied club manufactured by Callaway Golf in California . Golf clubs are divided into two groups : woods for tee and long fairway shots , irons for the fairways and approach shots . For the past decade , woods have been made of various metals and composites , and Big Bertha is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Bertha as the most forgiving club they 've ever seen . PAUL TUTTLE , World of Gulf : It 's a very easy to hit golf club . The oversized metal head makes it very forgiving . It 's enabled the average golfer who never hit a driver good to be able to hit a driver , get maximum distance and keep it in play in the fairway @!VANOCUR voice-over The problem was how do you make a large-headed , stainless club without making it so heavy that no one can hit it . RICHARD HELMSTETTER , President , Callaway Golf : We 've had to stretch the metal much farther .

Tonight , The Victim 's Crusade . In the crossfire , California Representative William Dannemeyer , sponsor of the Bergalis Bill . Dr. Les Seldin , spokesman for the American Dental Association . And registered nurse Barbara Fassbinder . PAT BUCHANAN : Good evening and welcome to Crossfire . Today Kimberly Bergalis , the 23-year-old Florida woman who 's dying of AIDS that was transmitted to her by her dentist , testified for 30 seconds before Congress . Her last request : pass the Dannemeyer bill which requires health care workers to tell their patients if they have the fatal and communicable disease . KIMBERLY BERGALIS , AIDS Patient : I did nothing wrong . I 'm being made to suffer like this . My life has been taken away . Please enact legislation so that no other patient or health care provider will have to go through the hell that I have @!BUCHANAN Kimberly 's father expressed the family anger at what he called the preferential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father : It 's time for Congress to get off their duff and to say , for ten years we have treated this issue not as a disease , but as a civil rights issue and the protection of privacy issue , as anything other than a disease that this country 's ever had before . Why is AIDS deserving of preferential treatment ? Our daughter , as I said , is an example of that inactivity , inability , unwillingness- she 's going to die because of that @!BUCHANAN Tonight , why should n't health care workers tell their patients if they have this horrible disease that can be contracted and can kill ? Michael ? MIKE KINSLEY : Congress Dannemeyer , your bill would n't simply require health care workers to tell their patients they had AIDS . It would require testing of health care workers who do invasive procedures , surgeons , dentists and so on . Now , public affairs experts say that would cost about $ 500 million a year . Is that about right to you ? Representative WILLIAM DANNEMEYER , ( R ) California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should we make very clear that my bill only relates to those health care workers , surgeons and dentists , who are engaging in invasive procedures , which is a relatively small percentage of all people practicing medicine or dentistry in this country , and I think it 's appropriate for them to be tested . It 's not an intrusion into their life and if they are HIV positive , then they would be required to get the written consent of their patients before they get- KINSLEY : But is it correct that it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars a year , $ 500 million a year to conduct these tests ? Rep. DANNEMEYER : Absolutely not @!KINSLEY How much would it cost ? Rep. DANNEMEYER : The U.S.- no one knows that for sure @!KINSLEY Well , do n't you think before you- Rep. DANNEMEYER : We know , Michael , that we can- the U.S. Army has been conducting tests routinely for several years at less than $ 5 per test , and you can easily calculate what the cost of that would be @!KINSLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million a year . You are the one who is proposing to make this a law . You 're behaving like a conservative parody of a liberal saying , I want to do this in a law and I 'm not even willing to give a number of how much it would cost . How much would it cost ? Rep. DANNEMEYER : Let me say that , you know , every life is precious . It 's not- you know , we ca n't equate lives with cost . We have to enforce the public health laws of this country . I think quite frankly what this really comes down to is that when any of us go to see a doctor or a dentist we ought not to get a fatal disease @!KINSLEY Well , here 's the problem . You have to equate lives with cost because we spend money to save lives and we do n't spend money and it costs lives . For example , people- children are dying of measles in this country because the government has run out of money- is unwilling to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me it would- that 's a lot less than $ 500 a year . Before you start spending $ 500 million or whatever figure on this testing , you ought to say , is this the most efficient way to save innocent lives ? Rep. DANNEMEYER : Well , since you have such an obvious interest in the cost figure , Michael , I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do for you . I 'm going to make a calculation and bring it over to you . You can share it with your listeners . The cost of this- KINSLEY : Should n't you have made that calculation before you propose it ? BUCHANAN : For heaven 's sakes , if it 's $ 5 for an AIDS test and there are 100,000 doctors and dentists , that 's $ 500,000 @!KINSLEY He wants to test all the patients , too . Rep. DANNEMEYER : No , wait a minute . I just said- BUCHANAN : I mean , you 're talking about the guys that are doing basic surgery . Let me get Dr. Seldin- Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get off the money issue here @!BUCHANAN All right . Let 's get off the money issue and let 's get on the basic health question . Even if the danger of transmission from a Dr. Acer to Kimberly Bergalis is insignificant , does n't the patient have a right to know that there 's a slim chance that they can get a horrible communicable and fatal disease from this invasive surgery ? Dr. SELDIN : If we are doing invasive surgery , if we are doing what the CDC has now established as exposure prone procedures which have yet to be defined , we would suggest and support the position that the ADA has concurred with the CDC , yes , let 's tell our patients and let them make a decision @!BUCHANAN Well , let 's not simply suggest . Let 's make it mandatory on people who do these kinds of procedures that they tell the patients they 're at risk . Example : when you had the flu and the flu vaccine , maybe there was one in ten million chance that somebody would react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needles had a right to know that and a lot of them said , well , I do n't want to take that chance , forget the needle , I do n't want the flu vaccine . Do n't they have a right to know if the dentist sitting there who 's going to pull a tooth has AIDS ? Dr. SELDIN : What makes you feel that the dentist or the health care practitioner is going to be irresponsible and not follow those guidelines that- BUCHANAN : Dr. Acer convinces me he might . Dr. SELDIN : No , you go back to when Dr. Acer , in fact , was treating Kimberly Bergalis and let us put now in perspective that the Kimberly Bergalis , Barbara Webb and the other three unfortunate victims of this incident- BUCHANAN : Five people are going to die because of this clown . Dr. SELDIN : I do n't consider that his position at that time , 1987 , was one of a clown . We were n't thinking in 1987 about the possibility of- BUCHANAN : Why were you not thinking- Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the transmission and risk of health care worker to patient at that time . In 1987 we were concerned about infection control , protecting the health care worker . That 's what we were seeing on television . Rep. DANNEMEYER : May I- KINSLEY : Many more health care workers have died than- Rep. DANNEMEYER : Let me- KINSLEY : No health care patient that we know of has died . Rep. DANNEMEYER : Let me inject something in here I think the American public needs to hear . The CDC , the Center for Disease Control , has developed a computer model that postulates that we have a 128 patients in this country just like Kimberly Bergalis , and this computer model says that we have 1,248 dentists who are HIV carriers and 336 surgeons ; and we know that about 40 to 50,000 health care workers today are HIV positive and we know that 6,438 health care workers have been diagnosed as fully developed AIDS . Dr. SELDIN : And what are computer models worth ? We are talking about statistical machinations . The ADA went out- BUCHANAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUCHANAN : You 're talking about dead people also . We know that five people have got it . Dr. SELDIN : That 's correct @!BUCHANAN I mean- Dr. SELDIN : And we know that five people got it in Dr. Acer 's office . We do not know the mode of transmission- BUCHANAN : Tell me why you 're against it . Why are you against testing people who do invasive surgery and giving the patients the information ? Dr. SELDIN : We are not opposed to that . I am in favor of that . What I am opposed to is the concept of legislating it as a mandatory issue . It is not necessary @!KINSLEY Congressman Dannemeyer , there actually is increasing evidence that Dr. Acer was exactly what Pat says , a clown . He was very irresponsible about his sanitary precautions , possibly some people even say in some way was trying infect his patients on purpose . Now , he is the only known case , the only known case of a doctor actually transmitting this disease . There 's no way , is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was purposely trying to make them sick ? You do n't have to have AIDS to purposely try and make your patients sick , do you ? Rep. DANNEMEYER : Well , I think the- 92 percent of the American people agree with the position that I 've taken , that when any of us go to a doctor and a dentist we should n't come out with a fatal disease . Dr. SELDIN : I do n't believe in leaning on public opinion polls to determine the best interest that the health care professions have for the public . Rep. DANNEMEYER : You know , it depends on whose ox is being gored . This business where I serve in the House of Representatives , if somebody 's on the other side and they had a poll that 's like I do they 'd be quoting it right now @!BUCHANAN Dr. Seldin , from a health care standpoint , Dr. Seldin , even an insignificant threat , it would seem that the objective of health care workers is to provide the maximum possible protection for their patients . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the argument against it ? Dr. SELDIN : The argument against it is that we do not have in this point in time a national emergency that demands legislation . We have an- one case in Florida which has cast a pall and a fear amongst the people of this country . We have tried to address the problem . We 've tried to address it by dealing with the prevention of the disease . This mandatory testing does n't prevent the disease @!BUCHANAN How can it hurt that all- how can it hurt your people if they are simply required by law to get the tests and required by law to tell their patients , how will that hurt your people ? Dr. SELDIN : How will it hurt my people ? It will hurt my people only when things must change . The CDC in the development of guidelines , the emanation of the disease and the development of- all the changes that have taken place over the past ten years , it 's a dynamic process . Rep. DANNEMEYER : What- Dr. SELDIN : No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early July- Rep. DANNEMEYER : The civil rights of the infected take precedence over the civil rights of the uninfected . That 's what 's going on @!BUCHANAN Sure @!KINSLEY No , I 'll tell you what the cost is . The cost is this is a one in 21 million chance-that was what the latest estimate is-of catching AIDS in an hour of surgery . Rep. DANNEMEYER : Michael , there are- KINSLEY : We have limited resources in this country , limited financial resources , limited political resources , limited time of our valuable congressmen to address issues , and the question is , why are you devoting your time and the taxpayers ' resources to a problem of one in 21 million ? Rep. DANNEMEYER : There 's 191,000 people in this country that have been diagnosed with AIDS , 3 to 4 percent of them- the CDC says they ca n't tell us the means of transmission . That , if I 've calculated right , is about 8,000 people . I 'm not saying that among those 8,000 there are Kimberly Bergalis 's , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us how those 8,000- KINSLEY : You were just citing the Center for Disease Control a while back- Rep. DANNEMEYER : That 's right @!KINSLEY Now , you 're saying you do n't believe them . Well , anyway , when we come back we 're going to hear the flip side of the Kimberly Bergalis story . We 'll talk to a nurse who caught AIDS from a patient but testified today against Congressman Dannemeyer 's bill . Find out why in a moment . Commercial break KINSLEY : Welcome back to Crossfire . Should there be mandatory AIDS testing of doctors , nurses , dentists , and patients ? That 's the gist of the so-called Kimberly Bergalis bill , proposed by our guest Representative William Dannemeyer of California . Kimberly Bergalis is the young woman who seems to have caught AIDS from her dentist . Joining us also is Les- Dr. Les Seldin , a dentist in New York , and spokesman for the American Dental Association , which opposes mandatory testing . And joining us now is Barbara Fassbinder a registered nurse from Lamoni , Iowa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected with the AIDS virus ? BARBARA FASSBINDER , Registered Nurse , HIV Positive : I became infected in August of 1986 in an emergency room in a small hospital in Wisconsin , when I was assisting in resuscitating a young man who came into the emergency room and stopped breathing , and during the course of the resuscitation some blood from an artery seeped through some gauze onto my finger that had small cuts on it and his blood entered the small cuts on my finger @!KINSLEY Well , in light of your experience , why do you oppose Congressman Dannemeyer 's bill which might have made it possible- might have resulted in testing of this patient so you might have had the option not to serve him or whatever ? Ms. FASSBINDER : Excuse me , but mandatory testing would not have done a thing for me at that time . The tests at that time- it was one to two weeks . He had a cardiopulmonary arrest within an hour of his arrival in the emergency room . Emergency personnel find themselves in situations like this all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal precautions because we , especially in emergency settings , you can not know who is infected and who is not @!BUCHANAN Ms. Fassbinder , Pat Buchanan . Obviously it was an odd chance that happened whereby in this situation medical worker and patient , you acquired AIDS . Now , it might be rare and it 's going to be an add chance in the future but if the health worker has AIDS and especially does routine or regular invasive procedures , why should n't an innocent patient at least know there is some risk , even if a long shot , a very long shot , of catching a really terrible and fatal disease that is certainly going to kill them ? Why should n't the patient at least know there 's some risk there ? Ms. FASSBINDER : I think the issue really is public education at this point . The public needs to be aware of the level of risk that 's involved , you agree , but the information of a surgeon 's HIV status is really irrelevant compared to what is his level of practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me- Ms. FASSBINDER : -adhere to the universal precautions @!BUCHANAN OK . Let me take the case of the cardiac pulmonary arrest . A patient comes in with a heart failure . You 've got to do open heart surgery . You 've got a doctor who 's coming maybe off a golf course or something like that and he 's sweating and this is hours and fluids are all over the place . Now- in other words , there is a chance , a very long shot that this- the patient , maybe , who does n't have AIDS can contract this through this exchange of fluids . Why should n't a patient if he can get the knowledge and you have the knowledge at least be alert to the fact that there 's a long shot chance that he could get it so at least he can make a decision to say , well , no , I want another doctor in some other situation ? Ms. FASSBINDER : Excuse me but your analogy there just does n't fit . There 's been no reported cases of contracting HIV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , there is no chance of body fluids mixing . The surgeon has to get cut and bleed into an open patient wound @!BUCHANAN All right . I mean , that- Ms. FASSBINDER : Through gloves @!BUCHANAN OK . That can- well , that can perhaps , I mean , remotely happen . Something happened there to you , but what is the problem , Ms. Fassbinder , for surgeons and dentists , dentists who do oral surgery and surgeons to be tested beforehand and if they have the HIV simply to tell their patients or let patients on whom they work know that there 's a remote chance of a transfer of blood between the two of them in some kind of invasive procedure so a patient can at least make his own decision ? Ms. FASSBINDER : Well , I agree that voluntary testing by all health care workers who do invasive- exposure prone invasive procedures especially is very important so that they can seek proper counseling , so that their practice can be reviewed , so they can be reviewed to see if they 're competent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for joining us . We 'll be back to discuss that AIDS Commission . Is President Bush doing enough for AIDS sufferers or is the government doing more for them than for anybody else ? Commercial break BUCHANAN : Dr. Seldin , despite the fact that the American people , I think , spend more per capita on AIDS research than any other disease in history , as much as we spend for heart disease and cancer which kill 15 and 30 times as many , do you not think it is outrageous of the AIDS Commission to blast the President for lack of leadership on this ? Dr. SELDIN : No , I really do n't . The AIDS Commission blasted the President because he felt that there was no leadership from the White House on this issue and with all that 's been going on , and I grant you he 's had a lot of things on his mind , I think that it 's something that the American public has centered on and needs attention to from our leadership @!BUCHANAN How can- I mean , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many shows we 've done in the last two years on diseases . My guess is we 've done 25 on AIDS and maybe zero on other diseases . It is true of every TV show in the country . Presidents have spoken , they 've been fund raisers . It 's a front page issue . How can anybody say we have n't focused on this disease which kills 36,000 people , less than die of breast cancer each year ? Dr. SELDIN : We 're focusing on it but not in the same way that we might be focusing on research for other areas of disease . We need to put money and develop and put the man power into developing better ways of protecting , treating and helping these people , not only those who already have the disease , but those who we would like to prevent- KINSLEY : Congressman Dannemeyer , it seems to me that Pat 's criticism applies to you as well as to the AIDS Commission . Here you are with limited attention saying- of trying to obsess the country even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much money is being spent on AIDS . You 're proposing to require a massively expensive testing program , costs hundreds of millions of dollars that also could be spent on other diseases , yet you are- Rep. DANNEMEYER : We 're spending $ 1.8 billion this year on AIDS and I hope we find a cure , a vaccine . That 's far more than we 're spending on any heart disease- KINSLEY : But you 're proposing to spend more , even more . Rep. DANNEMEYER : And I think it 's appropriate that the civil rights of the uninfected people take precedence over the civil rights of the infected . I want to cite a study by John Colombotos , Ph.D . at Columbia University- KINSLEY : Briefly , sir . Rep. DANNEMEYER : - School of Public Health , of physicians and registered nurses , about a thousand physicians , 1500 nurses , 57 percent of the doctors support the idea of mandatory testing and 63 percent of the nurses support mandatory testing . We 've had voluntary guidelines since 1957- or 1987 , excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Dr. SELDIN : I can tell you- KINSLEY : I 've got to- he ran out the clock . Thank you , Congressman Dannemeyer . Thank you , Dr. Seldin . I 'll drill Pat here in a bit . Commercial break KINSLEY : Pat , this is not a matter of civil rights as you keep saying . It 's a matter of sensible public health policy . The risk of getting AIDS from your surgeon is one in millions , 21 million , according to the latest study . Yes , in theory people have the right to know . It costs too much money to test everyone to find out . It makes no sense @!BUCHANAN You use the $ 500 million figure . That is $ 5,000 per single little AIDS test for 100,000 health workers . Where do you get these nutsy numbers ? KINSLEY : You 've got to test the health workers , you 've got to test the patients . Far more workers than patients catch AIDS . You 've got to test them frequently to make sure they have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs @!BUCHANAN People , Michael , people have a right to know , even if there 's a minuscule danger of catching this fatal disease @!KINSLEY You ca n't know everything in the world there 's a one in 21 chance of happening to you . It costs too much money , Pat @!BUCHANAN Why are you protecting these doctors and dentists with AIDS ? Tell me @!KINSLEY I 'm not- I 'm protecting your pocketbook , Pat , for a change . From the left , I 'm Mike Kinsley . Good night for Crossfire @!BUCHANAN Money over public health- KINSLEY : Oh , please @!BUCHANAN When did you take that position , Michael ?

Then , as the Scenic-Cruiser eased off the expressway and approached the New Orleans terminal , the sandman finally worked his magic , and the kid in cowboy boots was at last still , peaceful . Big Ben whispered to his son when the bus stopped , but he got no response , so he lifted the boy gently and got in line with the others headed toward the door . They were off the bus and on the concrete boarding ramp when Little Ben awakened with a quick stretch . He looked up and spotted the large clock near the ceiling of the covered walkway . He pointed to it and said , \" Tick-tock . \" \" That 's right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past nine . Sixteen hours from Dallas on a Greyhound . He slid the boy off his shoulder and they proceeded hand-in-hand into the waiting room , between the phone clusters , past the gift shop with white ceramic elephants in its windows , and finally out and into the city of strangers . They paused for Big Ben to pull the little guy into a worn , sleeveless sweatshirt . The shapeless , oversized garment drooped like a blanket . They got directions from a craggyfaced man who stood , whistling , by a newspaper rack , and within a half hour , the Bens ? Big and Little ? were midway through their foggy trek toward that night 's lodging . It had rained earlier and most likely it would rain later , but squeezed curiously into the gap between those two wets was a plug of gauzy moist ? a thick , gossamer cloud that had simply squatted on St. Charles Avenue from the Circle on up . At every other street or so , Big Ben would switch his son to the other shoulder . He assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hummed the only tune he could think of , \" I 'd Waltz Across Texas With You . \" They passed a restaurant with plaster lions at the entrance , and the boy began to whimper . And so , father and son left the sidewalk and took to the grassy middle space that had tracks down its center . Traffic on both sides moved timidly , headlights turning pavement into ebony mirrors . Streetlamps wore hoods of palest saffron . And meanwhile , the surrounding silverness confused distances , twisted perspectives , lulled senses . Finally to their left were the lighted windows with flowercolors . Big Ben hoisted his rider high and seated the boy astride his neck . This should be Washington Avenue , he thought , so he summoned a bit of untapped vigor and moved almost skippingly from the center tracks , edging curbward . That 's when a savage clanging tore through the mother-ofpearl mist , and a yellow beacon came thrusting toward them . It whushed by , perilously near , and the man went rigid , incapable of backing back farther from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then was gone . A slight rigor had shaken the boy . He had reached silently for Big Ben 's forehead , and his tiny boots had clutched in unison at the man 's chest . Then , all at once , the man lifted the boy down and into his arms , holding tight , and they were walking along a side street , waiting at a red light , passing a white-walled graveyard . They came to a street without trees and turned right . The man saw it half a block away , the red shield aglow through the fog . Salvation Army Men 's Lodge . His hope quickened . At first , the men next morning at this haven for the broken and the broke viewed the boy with caution , unaccustomed as they were to having a 20-month-old youngster at their breakfast table . Any attention they paid him was indirect ; they studied him with side glances . They camouflaged their curiosity , but by mid-morning after the two Bens ' first night at the lodge , the story was known . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries to determine identity and to be sure kidnapping was not involved . As proof , the father had produced his wife 's death certificate . The boy 's mother had died in childbirth , and the young father , still in his early 20s , had insisted on keeping his son . He had supported the infant by washing dishes at a Dallas restaurant until last week , when he was laid off . He expected to find employment in Gulfport , where his sister lived , but New Orleans was as far as he could get on the money he had . He had written his sister and was hoping to hear . The first thing Little Ben did after breakfast was to totter forth to the front of the TV viewing room , his cowboy boots clicking on the linoleum tiles , and point assuredly toward the clock above the television set . \" Tick-tock , \" he declared . After that , the few men who had watches let him listen to them while sitting on their laps , then lent the watches to others who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bens got fresh , clean clothes , but no word from Gulfport . When the men lined up that night for supper , one fellow with a portable radio shared the earphones with Little Ben , and the result was a drop in the popularity of television but a rise in the popularity of watching kids listening to radio . And still , no word from Gulfport . The next morning Little Ben ambled out into the back yard area of the lodge and promptly discovered the meaning of wonderful . It was a wonderful visitor to the place , a wonderfully frisky , wonderfully loving , wonderfully whitewhiskered , green-eyed , gray-all-over tomcat that smiled ( sometimes ) . The boy pointed to it and said , \" Tick-tock , \" and rubbed the animal 's tummy when it rolled over . That night the Bens were n't at supper . There had been word from Gulfport . Afterwards , not very many guys stayed up to watch TV . And in the sleeping dormitories , nobody had much to say . If the thought of the kid crossed anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day 's doings in the back yard area were enough to make one visiting tomcat which smiled ( sometimes ) figure that he belonged there at the Salvation Army Men 's Lodge .

Its only furnishings consisted of some long sofas and a small table , on top of which there stood a lighted lamp ; the lamp was topped by a pale yellow lampshade featuring a picture of a boat . In the picture four rough-looking men each held an oar ; three of the oars were largely submerged . The fourth , which stood out most clearly in the picture , appeared to be made of cedar . In its lower section -- where it was widest -- someone had made some fairly deep cuts that resembled a human face , albeit somewhat confusedly ; it was difficult to determine whether that form had been sought intentionally or whether it was a mere figment of the imagination , evident only to the observer inclined to see it . The face seemed to be that of an Indian ? most notably in the region of the cheeks , from the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lines on the left cheek depicted a Portuguese or a Spanish galleon , with its sail strained to the breaking point , as if by the force of a strong wind . A tiny lookout , stationed at his observation post , seemed to wave his arms , eager to advise the crew of their possible proximity to land . The captain , standing on the deck , remained absorbed in his own thoughts , oblivious to the gesticulation of the lookout . Nor did he seem to notice a map that lay close by one of his boots , strangely unaffected by the wind which persisted in its struggle to break the resistance of the solid sails . It was a map of Africa surrounded by long lines indicating the circumnavigational routes . One of these routes , marked in bright red , ended at a spot on the coast of what is today known as Nigeria .

Next to the hut a woman , seated and with her legs crossed , could be seen inserting a fish into an almost cylindrical opening in the earth . A few inches away was a ceramic jug containing some leftover food that failed to obscure entirely the folk scene adorning the interior surface of the receptacle . It pictured a hunting party : a group of aborigines chasing a deer . Their weapons were surely the same ones they used for intertribal combat ; otherwise there was no possible explanation for the large shields they carried , all of them bearing colorful illustrations on their external surfaces . Some of these illustrations had been damaged , perhaps by enemy lances in recent skirmishes ; but on one of the shields the layer of pigments derived from plant matter had apparently survived intact . The painted areas , the outlines of which were not very sharp , at a distance nevertheless took on the exact shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization of invaders and not to the civilization of the creator of the shield , its design had been reproduced to perfection : the handle featured a golden cross , on which a Christ of pallid complexion lay dying . A soldier of the Empire , who seemed to spring from the handle of the saber , stood gallantly at the side of the Redeemer ; in his right hand he held a parchment containing incomprehensible annotations , no doubt purely a product of the painter 's imagination . The only decipherable element on the parchment was a drawing at the top , comparable to a letterhead . It represented the mythological character Perseus , his eyes fixed on a mirror to avoid the icy gaze of the Gorgon , who stood behind him . However , the image in the mirror was not Medusa 's face but a landscape , perhaps the environs of the temple , reflected on the shiny surface through one of the rare openings in its main facade . The landscape consisted of an endless expanse of open field , devoid of trees or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which there appeared only the majestic figure of a gigantic bird , its wings fully spread . The bird was in every respect similar to an airplane ; its small eye -- the only one visible -- could easily have been the side window of a cockpit . Additionally , the creature 's small pupil , which contained a blemish at the top perhaps as a result of some eye infection , was the very picture of a pilot 's head covered by a visored helmet , in the center of which a golden glimmer evoked the insignia of the air force of a neighboring country . This insignia was comprised of three juxtaposed logotypes , shaped respectively like a ship , an airplane and a railroad -- the concomitance of those three objects symbolizing recognition of the brotherhood of all the national transportation networks . The locomo-## tive standing on the railroad tracks displayed the emblem of the staterun company to which it belonged : the sketchy shape of a building behind big letters spelling out the company 's name . Without a doubt , the building was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the schematic quality of the design failed to express that too clearly . One window on the top floor of the edifice was scarcely visible . Judging by what little could be seen , it did n't belong to an office or to any room ; it only opened onto a corridor , dotted with two rows of doors of diffuse outlines . One of the doors appeared to be open , although it was still possible to discern on the brass plaque identifying it the name and position of a high-ranking public official . Inside the room , the only thing Rodriquez could make out -- and that with great effort -- was a painting that occupied almost a third of the surface of the wall . But it was impossible to see what that painting contained . Disappointed , he directed his gaze elsewhere . \r\n##1001851 Something big Nelsen , Robert S Triquarterly ; Spring 1990 ; 78 ; Research Library ## Something Big Robert S. Nelsen With her hand , the mother pulled the boy toward the bathtub . The boy felt as though he were a bull , a bull being dragged by the horns through the yellow ooze of the fly dip out back beside the bulls ' corral . This was the boy 's first bath in this new house ; he had arrived just a week ago . The boy had walked up the lane to the house and had stared into the house through the screen door until the mother opened the door and motioned for him to enter . At the screen door , the boy had been silent , and there before that bathtub , the boy was silent still . The boy looked at that bathtub perched on top of iron eagles ' feet . Looking at the bathtub and its eagles ' feet moved the boy closer to the mother . The mother walked around behind the boy , and the boy could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy could feel the mother press her body against his back , wedging him between her soft legs , wedging the boy from his feet to where his head fit into where the mother 's legs stopped . The boy was five years old . \" Off with your clothes , \" the mother said in a singsong voice . \" That 's law number one of the bathtub laws . \" The mother quickly stripped the boy of his shirt and stockings and threw the shirt and stockings toward the clothes hamper . One stocking missed going into the clothes hamper and stuck to the outside of the clothes hamper . The boy 's eyes moved from the stocking back to the bathtub , and he knew that this time he would do something more than lighting a fire , maybe stealing something big . With the boy wedged between the mother 's legs from his feet to where his head fit into where the mother 's legs stopped , the mother undid the buttons on the boy 's pants . Her hand stopped as it reached into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bare penis , and discovered that he ## was wearing no underwear . The mother quickly withdrew her hand and coughed , or at least the boy thought that it was a cough he heard . The boy felt the mother pry his body from her body . The mother turned the boy to face her . The boy could see red in the moon-shaped cheeks and thick neck of the mother . The boy did not know how many bathtub laws existed , but he was certain that one of the laws , just like the laws at the other six houses in which he had lived , would say wear underwear . With his pants still unsnapped , the boy looked up at the mother 's round face framed by her home-cut gray hair , and he smiled at her . The mother did not frown , but the mother did not smile either . The boy continued smiling . Smiles usually worked for him . \" Take off your pants , and turn on the cold water , \" the mother said . The boy obediently took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naked , the boy sat down on the edge of the bathtub , his bare feet dangling in the air above the bathtub 's eagles ' feet . The boy looked around the bathroom for something to steal , for something big . Finding nothing except for a half-empty bottle of perfume that could not possibly be worth stealing , the boy looked to see if the mother wore a ring that he could steal , but he saw that she did not . \" Feel how deep the water is , \" the mother said , her voice cutting through the noise of the water squirting from the cold-water spigot and splashing against the cold water colored yellow by the bathtub 's ruststained porcelain . \" An inch of cold water is all you need . That 's what law number two of the bathtub laws says . \" The boy turned and sniffed at the yellowed water . The water smelled to him as though it were stewed-cabbage water . The boy stuck his two hands in the water , and with the two hands flat on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . The water , the boy guessed , must be close to an inch deep . The boy took his hands from the yellow water and showed the mother one finger , meaning that the water was one inch deep . \" That 's perfect , \" the mother said . \" Turn it off . It 's time for law number three . Add an inch of hot water to the cold water . \" The boy bent down and turned on the hot water . With the hot water splashing against the cold water already in the bathtub , the boy stared at the mother , and the mother stared back at the boy . Since the day that the boy had stared into the house through the screen door , the mother had referred to herself as Mother ; the boy , on the other hand , had never offered a name or any other words for that matter . The boy dropped his stare from the mother 's eyes to the swirling water in the bathtub . As soon as he saw the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something big to steal . Again seeing nothing worth stealing , the boy knew that he would have to go outside to steal something big , something like a horse or a bull or a tractor or a dog or maybe one of the neighbor 's sheep . The boy 's hands , feeling the depth of the water , moved down and then up the cracked , yellowed porcelain of the bathtub . The boy held up two fingers this time for the mother and turned off the hot water . \" Get in and lie down , \" the mother said , \" and get yourself good and wet . That 's law number four . Five says stand up and soap your body , every inch of it . Then , after you are all soaped up , six says lie back down in the water and wash all that soap off your body . I 've got some washing of my own to do . You 're on your own till I get back . \" Lying there in the yellowed bathtub water , the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door close behind her . Quickly , the boy stood up and lathered his body with soap . Then the boy lay down in the bathtub and spread his legs wide . With soap bubbles from his body floating in the water around him in what looked to the boy like soap islands , the boy took hold of his penis and pretended that his penis was a bull 's horn , and he shoved his bull 's horn up and through one soap island after another . Again and again the boy shoved the bull 's horn up through the water , ramming it clean through , bursting the soap islands into disappearing pieces . The boy heard what he thought was a cough again and turned to see the mother beside the bathtub . The boy saw the red in the round cheeks and stout neck of the mother , the red that the boy had seen in the cheeks and neck of the mother when she discovered that he wore no underwear . The boy sunk into the yellow water to be out of sight of the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his naked body even bigger . The mother said , \" What do you think you 're doing ? Stop . Stop it right now . Not in my house you do n't . \" The boy watched the mother take a step toward him and then turn and leave the bathroom without saying anything more . The boy listened to the door close , hearing it close softer than he expected . The boy rolled over in the bathtub and felt as though now he were a bull stranded in the yellow ooze of the fly dip out back beside the bulls ' corral . The boy gripped his bull 's horn and rammed the horn against the bottom of the bathtub . In return , or so it seemed to the boy , the bathtub rammed back at the bull 's horn . Again , even harder , the boy rammed the bull 's horn against the bottom of that bathtub . The bathtub rammed back against the boy so hard that he hurt all the way from his ## horn to his spine . Faster and faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faster and faster the bath rose up and rammed itself against the boy . With tears in his eyes , the boy rolled over back upright in the bathtub . Today , the boy decided , today had to be the day to steal something big . The boy decided that he could not steal a horse or a bull or a tractor or a dog or even one of the neighbor 's sheep today because he could not think of a place where he could hide anything that big , not today . But the boy did think of the neighbor 's raspberries , and the neighbor 's strawberries , and the neighbor 's tomatoes that he could steal today , things that he could eat and would not have to hide . The boy stared at the bathtub that had hurt the boy from his bull 's horn to his spine . The boy doubled his fist , and , just as he was about to punch the bathtub , he heard the bathroom door open and the mother begin talking . \" O.K. , only two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" and you are going to like both of them . Law number seven says baths do n't have to last more than ten minutes , and law number eight says you only have to take one bath a week . See , you 're done and you did n't even drown . \" Smiling , the mother turned and left the bathroom , this time without closing the door . The boy jumped out of the bathtub and wiped the towel once over his hair , once over his front and once over his back . Freed from the yellow water of the bathtub , the boy thought only of the neighbor 's garden with its raspberries and its strawberries and its tomatoes . From the clothes hamper , the boy took his shirt , pants and stockings , pulling the one stocking from where it was still stuck on the outside of the clothes hamper . The boy did not bother with underwear . Outside the screen door , the boy grabbed his boots , and he stamped his feet into his boots there on the front porch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the house . In his boots , the boy ran to the horse 's pen next to the bulls ' corral and the fly dip . The boy climbed into the horses ' pen and I laid himself down in the dust hole that the horses used to dry themselves off . Over and over the boy rolled in the dust hole , just as he had seen the horses roll around in the dust hole after being unsaddled . The boy stood up , and he spat into his hands and rubbed the spit into the dust covering his face . \" Bathtub , \" the boy shouted , \" die ! Stay away from me and my dirt , or I 'll cut your eagles ' feet off . \" The boy ran to the barn and he unhooked two of the milk buckets that hung on nails pounded into a wooden beam in the room where the ## mother separated the cream from the milk . The separating machine beside the boy glittered as spotless stainless steel glitters . The boy , the boy ready to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked at the separating machine and dashed out of the barn . Outside , the boy swung the milk buckets over his head . The milk buckets glittered at the boy as the mother 's separating machine in the barn had glittered at the boy . The boy put the milk buckets close to his legs to stop the buckets from glittering , and he walked down the lane . The heels of his boots raised no sound , but looking behind himself , the boy saw the heels kick spurts of dust into the air . Seeing the spurts of dust and then looking back down the lane toward the neighbor 's garden and seeing one of the neighbor 's black sheep grazing right next to the garden made the boy laugh . The top strand of barbed-wire fence in front of the neighbor 's garden buzzed when the boy touched it . The boy tossed the mother 's two milk buckets over the barbed-wire fence , and , on his back , the boy began wiggling under the barbed-wire fence . Halfway between the mother 's land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of the wire barbs , unsnapping the snaps on his shirt and opening the shirt up . The boy 's bare chest shone there before his eyes , a clean bare chest , a bare chest cleaned by that bathtub and its bathtub laws . The boy twisted his head , looked at the neighbor 's garden , unhooked his shirt from the barbed wire and wiggled the rest of his body onto the neighbor 's land . The boy grabbed the milk buckets and ran to the raspberry bushes . The raspberry bushes were bare . The strawberry plants were bare too , and even the tomato vines were bare . The boy sat the milk buckets in the garden 's dirt and dropped quickly to his hands and knees . On all fours , the boy searched for something big to steal . Up and down the rows he went on his hands and knees until he finally found a partial row of cabbages and a small patch of unweeded radishes . The boy pulled up a handful of radishes , looked at them , and tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabbage plant and wiggled back and forth until , with a popping sound , the cabbage tore loose in the boy 's hands . The boy placed the cabbage in one of the milk buckets . The cabbage covered the shiny bottom of the bucket and came halfway up the sides . The boy straddled another cabbage , wiggling it , pulling on it until it tore loose in his hands , and then he tossed the cabbage into the other milk bucket . The boy threw the milk buckets with the cabbages in them over the barbed wire fence , and he wiggled underneath the bottom strand of barbed wire back onto the mother 's land . The boy took hold of the stainless-steel handles of the milk buckets , and , swaying from side to side ## and swinging the buckets out in front of him , he walked back up the lane to the bulls ' corral next to the yellow ooze of the fly dip . With the cabbages in his hands , the boy used his elbows to climb the pole fence . On top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took his pocketknife from his pocket . The boy cut into one of the cabbages and laid the pieces of cabbage on the pole that he was sitting on , squeezing the pieces with his legs so that they would not fall to the ground . The boy stabbed his hand and fingers with the pocketknife , and the boy dripped the blood from his hand and fingers onto the cabbage between his legs , turning the cabbage red with blood . With his bloodied hand , the boy tossed the blood-red cabbage to the bulls . The bulls sniffed at the blood-red cabbage and soon began eating the red pieces . The boy cut into the other cabbage and placed it between his legs on the pole and stabbed his other hand and fingers and dripped the new blood onto that cabbage , turning it the same blood red . The boy tossed the blood-red cabbage to the bulls , and placing his bloodied hands on top of his head as though they were bull 's horns , he watched the bulls below him fight over the cabbage . @ \r\n##1001852 Story of my weight Calcagno , Anne Triquarterly ; Spring 1990 ; 78 ; Research Library ## Story of My Weight Anne Calcagno Until the other day , I did not know my feet had become so crookedly misshapen and wide . I told myself my socks were unnecessarily thick ; the weather too hot ; it stood to reason my shoes were squeezing me . That was n't true . The things I owned or faced had n't twisted on me : it was me . I had changed without knowing it because I had n't looked my way for a long time . With my eyes focused away from me , I 've lived out my days in an interlude . Because when I suddenly saw the width of my warped feet , my eyes next traveled up the length of my legs , noticing mottled bruises like disheveled leaves rotting on my legs -- I have distractedly smashed into things . I moved to cover them , saw the back of my hand , vein-swelled and colorful , too , like a cabbage leaf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slack as silk . I was stunned ; as if it all happens in one day , the pieces lined up : I am not young . It feels as if I have always been fat . I married twenty-three years ago , have been overweight for twenty . Over time , I lost all personal perspective , grew overwhelmed in reaction to wide-eyed glances : when you 're fat you 're a focus . In public places , like the supermarket , they observe you until you ca n't get away from being your own prisoner . Wheeling my cart around , I peered at as much as I could , before fleeing . I 've been an exaggeration of cells , a reduced woman . My short blond hair curls into squat corkscrews , tips up ; sometimes , when the perm is running out , I look bristling . Yet , when the harried supermarket cashier glances up , I 'm the one whose eyes roll into her lap . This is how it is to be an anomaly . Yet , the point is : the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by widening corns , and it became terribly clear : like other women , conclusively mortal , I am going by degrees . No one is a constant picture . ## My disfigurement was a private affair . I ate and many things became mine . My consumption accumulated , giving me the appearance of having more years than my actual age . For many years , with a lot of effort , I still could have peeled off these layers and reached a young person . But it is too late . Time went ahead and did some real altering . I am forty-one and look like hell . I 've watched my failure . But my feet , the other day , were n't a continuation of this exaggerated flesh that haunts me . They were life and the broad response of time . I do n't know why I saw this . Age is an invisible train charging through the dark , wearing down the rails . Gradually , I 'd been feeling in need of repair . I grew to have more bent space inside . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I done ? My husband , perhaps two weeks before I looked at my feet , became aware of his own wearing-down . He began to feel his life erasing , tried to leap back from the movement of the train , the foreshortening of horizons . He grappled to stop losing things . He remembered me differently ; supple , eighteen , my eyes on the gravel , lifting up very quickly to notice he was there . I was like a leaf . He could have picked me up and taken me anywhere , kept me in his pocket , or pressed in a book . The other week , a martini in his hand , he said , \" You were sweet and your ankles were thin , hon ' . Now you 're close to a heart attack . \" \" What 's happened now ? \" I asked . \" For Chrissake , Susan , you 're wasting your life . Listen , I do n't want to watch you do this any more . Lose some weight . I 'll buy you dresses . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , Susan . We 've been waiting too long to do this . \" \" Harry , how did this come out of the blue ? \" I ventured . \" Do n't you understand what I 'm saying ? \" he replied . Harry is growing bald and his remaining disconnected hairs stood straight up with the lamplight gleaming behind them . He had finished his drink . He stared at me . We were in the middle of a movie episode and I was a girl in bright dresses , and he was a young dapper ready to love . But he was catching on fire with the lamplight gleaming around his head and shoulders . Harry invested himself in this rejuvenative idea , insistent . He had not talked to me much in a long time , yet now he repeated himself . \" You lose some weight . I 'll buy you dresses . What about the good old days ? \" These must have been in the beginning of our marriage . Being a salesman , he started going away . Absence became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a wide plateau ; crushing the good old days , he says . I ca n't remember the good old days . Five years ago , I did start to work . The newspaper ad looked for ## someone \" willing to learn . \" I am a secretary for an escort service , on the top floor of an old undecorated building . They call it a modeling agency . This is the way it 's done : hidden and glorified . I believed the disguise for a long time because that 's what you see looking up at you in the yellow pages . You have to read the fine print to figure out the code . And I did n't see it . Strangers in town get lonely , perhaps greedy . They call my boss , Rose , willing to pay . I file the accounts . An array of girls in tight colorful dresses and hose , with foreign accents or long hair , always in high heels , comes to the office dependent and warm , wanting more than they have . I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I am neutral practice for a man . I watch silent but accustomed . I keep thinking I 'm to give them something , but I ca n't find it . I have come to believe in the heart of every woman there is a secretary ; she wants to assist . These women are so different from me in their way of serving ; each is a bird full of plumes and her red fingernails hand me back the forms . But she is a secretary . And I am . I tried to explain this idea to Harry a while back . \" Hell , call them something better than secretaries . You ca n't get help like that from Kelly Girls ! \" His hand slaps his knee with gusto . In the beginning , I was happy because of the way he enjoyed his own jokes . \" It 's serious , \" I said . \" So many servants in the world . \" \" We all need people to rely on , sweet cakes . That 's what you forgot about when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found out the girls were n't models , I was amazed . Harry visited me at the office a couple of times to peek at photos . \" Act like I 'm an important account , \" he said . In the meantime he had a few salesman 's affairs , things in motels he lately informed me of . He was explaining his decision to help me regain the shape he met . Upset , he confessed , he could not make love to shapeless flesh ; he pursued women with angles and curves until it bored him . \" I ca n't remember one face , \" he said . \" You know that 's pretty sad . \" \" Why did you tell me that ? \" I said . \" Because when you try to understand yourself you need a confidante . When you tell someone else your sins , you 've got a responsibility to change . Now you 'll make me change , hon ' . \" \" I never wanted to know everything about you , \" I said . \" Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" Harry has always wanted the woman he loves to be so riveting that the envious stares of others around him will , like a magnetic force , keep him gravitated to her . I grew into a monstrosity . But the way they stared at me spun him away . ## After Harry confessed , I could n't get rid of what he had told me , and how my weight had ruined my life . Two weeks later , on a glazed and flat day , my feet caught my attention . I stared . Minute by minute I grew amazed , because my realization was unprecedented . I paused for some time . Looking at my feet , I saw that age had bitten into them . It did n't appear hesitant to finish its meal . And I do n't know why but then I knew that my hands , my eyes , my cartilage -- all of me -- was tied close to the same sounds and ways of others , held to the globe . I am what always happens in time , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I am in common . The only thing is : I do not want to become the shape of a woman Harry chased . If I am ever thin I will not have thrown off dead weight ; my husband will have pressed it into a thin red lining right under my skin ; that is what memory is like . Harry stormed into our house with yesterday 's picture in mind and stuck it on me . I am very full and he has decided I 'm just beginning . But no one can be emptied out . Never before has my aloneness been made so clear . There are other fat women like me ; I see them in the pastry aisles . But I am in myself alone . Harry has been out of town , on a job , for three days . At lunchtime , I went to the Red Cross shoe store and selected bright green comfort-fit pumps . Their sharp little heels protruded like horns from two tender cocoons . It was me and the geriatric ladies all belonging in the store together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things have blown open around me as if I had suddenly stepped over the horizon into a rushing wind : it lifts my hem , pulls my hair into disorder , swirls up my sleeves . Walking to work in this pictured disorder I 've realized I want someone to talk to , to explain this disarray . I feel newly in existence , terribly sensitive , sick of confinement . What is this ? An older woman . Unlike before , I 'm impelled to watch myself as a part of everyone . I know the women Harry slept with were likely to spend an hour getting ready to go out for coffee . He looked for this , having found me incapable of it . It was n't for him to see that their ardent self-description is an embroidery of hunger . When these women are as young as the escorts I work with , they feel the pulse of their generation clicking in their heels , and they toss and turn looking for something . They stretch into life like branches , to grow . My husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; instead , he felt out his advantage . Their limbs were octopus tentacles he could feast on . And when they were older did n't the women still seem to be looking for an answer ? By habit , they allow their men to imagine that they are waiting to be shown life . The men ## become accustomed mostly to devouring them blind . The women do n't ask for change . They do n't like change . They want to remain beautiful and wanted . Over the years it takes more and more time . Today , a girl walked into the office , rather tall in a red coat . Her hair was bleached , curling down her shoulders , her nose pointed , her mouth plump as a rosebud . She reminded me of a picture of the women at Louis XVI 's court in France , women in high hair and lace , with red cheeks , women decadent in their life , who at the end of the world said : \" Let them eat cake . \" I wondered if she knew about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world less than men ? \" I asked . She looked at me and her eyes turned very thin . \" Are you kidding ? Every one of those men had a mom , and if those moms had n't been preparing men for the world the men would n't be able to handle anything . \" She looked at her red fingernails . \" It takes a woman to know , \" she said . Then she leaned close to me . \" I know how to baby men , too , \" she said . \" Do n't do it , \" I said . \" Shit . I do n't have much time . Is this an interview ? \" She pulled her hose up , tightening them , first up her ankles , then along her thighs . \" They look at photos before the interview , \" I said . \" I look good , \" she said . Then Rose called the girl into her office . I made a collect call to my friend Rema , whom I 've known since childhood . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" Rema , thank God you 're home . Can you listen now ? \" \" Well , tell me . \" \" It just hit me like a ton of bricks that I have n't given myself a look in years . Who 've I been ? \" \" You 've been living , honey , \" Rema says . \" Where did you get this idea you have to stare at yourself all the time , to live ? That can hold you up . Plenty of people go nuts . \" \" No . We do n't have this idea straight , most of us : you have gold running in your veins , up to your heart ; if you see that , you begin to catch it . \" \" Some people might feel that way , \" she says . \" Sure some do . What 's been happening ? \" Her voice is patient as lake water . \" I ca n't understand myself why everything has changed , \" I say . \" Everything seems on fire . It makes me so nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , \" That 's how it is : you ca n't tell when the next thing is going to happen . \" After work I like to walk a few extra blocks to the bus for exercise . ## 11 People are so busy running home , I 'm unnoticed . Today , the yellow leaves were falling and breathing themselves into the wind , mingling a bitter scent of regret . I 've noticed each winter comes by advance of many tantrums ; the trees toss their heads , the grasses shake , disheveled , blown up , turned brown . Today , the leaves scurried over , wildly dancing between my feet while an endless blue blanket looked down , selfcontained . All at once , something darted at my feet . I pressed myself up against a wall . My heart nearly leapt out of my mouth . It was a squirrel now staring at me , flicking its tail , a yard away , raising itself on its hindquarters . It began to gesture at me by way of masticating though it had nothing in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this communication , chewing a mock meal , under the understanding that I had something to give them . And I do understand hunger . But I had nothing for them . On the bus going home I saw animals in people 's faces : a lynx , goats , the flamingo , a saddened spaniel . But they wo n't show their hunger . It saddens me to know I walked around for years in trepidation of myself without knowing or remembering about this hunger in others . I tried to hide my own but they saw it on my body . I peered out a small window which never opened . Every day circled me like gauze , and I was mummified into the years . My husband called it a disgrace . My heart closed like a little stone . Harry is ravenous for taut flesh yet now age flicks him around in its large jaw , tugs at his skin , decomposes his bones . He is amazed , denying so much hunger . I never had the brazen confidence to deny life 's big appetite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet life and time are always tapping in your ear to confide in you . Occasionally , I would be startled by sounds like a foreign song ; vague , remarkable music . I placed it far away . But chords were rising through me , to describe me . This is how potential approaches you : in no one else 's language . If you grasp it , other people sense it . It begins to announce itself . Like a song , you ca n't exactly say you see it . Mine rose up through my feet . I looked down at myself and saw the silent onslaught of years , the wide general thing represented in my feet . This is n't my failure . I have a double dimension of weight : one fat made me hide , but this can have grace because it 's everyone 's mirror . The night before Harry left on his present trip , he visited the supermarket . Lettuce , trim-fit dinners , broccoli , tomatoes , celery and crackers returned with him . He looked as happy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \" Here we go ! Now we 're ready , are n't we ? \" It was as if a beetle began crawling inside my stomach . ## \" The thing I want to tell you , honey , is that this is n't just about taking off pounds ; it 's about building a whole new spirit . A spic-and-span streamlined one , Susie . I can hardly wait . \" I looked straight at him . \" What I 'm concerned with is my spirit . But you ca n't get it with celery . How could you go looking in the supermarket ? \" Harry 's eyes retracted quick as crabs . \" You 're a coward ? \" he asked me . \" Are you ? Shit , you 're the biggest disappointment in my life . \" He turned around to the kitchen sink and spat in it .

The woman looked at me , inquiring ; she had opened the door a crack . I came closer and stood on the front step . \" No , \" she said , \" I do n't know you . \" \" I 'm the daughter of Mrs. S. , \" I said . She kept her hand on the door as though she wanted to prevent it from opening further . Her face did n't betray any sign of recognition . She kept looking at me silently . Maybe I 'm wrong , I thought , maybe she is n't the one . I had only seen her once in passing , and that was years ago . It was quite likely that I had pushed the wrong doorbell . The woman let go of the door and stepped aside . She was wearing a green hand-knitted sweater . The wooden buttons were slightly faded from laundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again hid partly behind the door . But now I knew that I was at the right address . \" You knew my mother , did n't you ? \" I asked . \" Did you come back ? \" said the woman . \" I thought that no one had come back . \" \" Only I , \" I said . In the hall behind her a door opened and closed . A stale smell came out . \" I 'm sorry , \" she said , \" I ca n't do anything for you . \" \" I 've come here especially on the train . I would have liked to speak with you for a moment . \" \" It 's not convenient now , \" said the woman . \" I ca n't invite you in . Another time . \" She nodded and carefully closed the door , as though no one in the house should be disturbed . I remained on the front step for a moment . ## The curtain of the bay window moved . \" Oh , nothing , \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" I looked at the nameplate once more . It said \" Dorling , \" with black letters on white enamel . And on the doorpost , a little higher , the number . Number 46 . While slowly walking back to the station , I thought of my mother , who had once , years ago , given me the address . It was during the first half of the war . I had come home for a few days , and it had struck me right away that something had changed in the rooms . I missed all sorts of things . My mother was surprised that I 'd noticed it so quickly . Then she told me about Mrs. Dorling . I had never heard of her before , but she seemed to be an old acquaintance of my mother 's whom she had n't seen in years . She had suddenly turned up and renewed the acquaintance . Since that time she had been coming regularly . \" Every time she leaves she takes something home with her , \" my mother said . \" She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique plates which hung over there . She really had a tough job lugging these big vases , and I 'm afraid that she hurt her back with the dishes . \" My mother shook her head with compassion . \" I would never have dared to ask her . She suggested it herself . She even insisted . She wants to save all my beautiful things . She says that we 'll lose everything when we have to leave here . \" \" Have you arranged with her that she 'll keep everything ? \" I asked . \" As though that were necessary , \" my mother exclaimed . \" It would be an insult to agree on something like that . And think of the risk she takes every time she leaves our house with a full suitcase or bag ! \" My mother seemed to notice that I was n't totally convinced . She looked at me reproachfully , and after that we did n't speak of it again . Without paying too much attention to the road I had arrived at the station . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar districts , but I did n't want to go further than absolutely necessary . I did n't want to torment myself with the sight of streets and houses full of memories of a cherished time . In the train back , I saw Mrs. Dorling before me again , the way I had met her the first time . It was the morning after the day my mother had told me about her . I had gotten up late , and as I went downstairs I saw that my mother was just seeing someone out . A woman with a broad back . \" There is my daughter , \" said my mother . She motioned to me . The woman nodded and picked up the suitcase which stood under the coatrack . She was wearing a brown coat and a shapeless hat . ## \" Does she live far ? \" I asked after seeing how laboriously she left the house with the heavy suitcase . \" On Marconistraat , \" said my mother . \" Number 46 . Do try to remember . \" I had remembered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going there . During the first period after the liberation I felt no interest at all in all that stored stuff , and of course some fear was involved . Fear of being confronted with things that had been part of a bond which no longer existed ; which had been stored in cases and boxes and were waiting in vain until they would be put back in their places ; which had survived all these years because they were \" things . \" But gradually everything had become normal again . There was bread which was steadily becoming lighter in color , there was a bed in which you could sleep without being threatened , a room with a view which you got more and more used to every day . And one day I noticed that I was becoming curious about all the possessions which should still be at that address . I wanted to see them , touch them , recognize them . After my first fruitless visit to Mrs. Dorling 's house , I decided to try it a second time . This time it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked whether her mother was home . \" No , \" she said , \" my mother is just on an errand . \" \" That does n't matter , \" I said , \" I 'll wait for her . \" I followed the girl through the hall . Next to the mirror hung an oldfashioned menorah . We had never used it because it was much more cumbersome than candles . \" Would n't you like to sit down ? \" asked the girl . She held open the door to the room and I went in past her . Frightened , I stood still . I was in a room which I both knew and did n't know . I found myself among things I had wanted to see again but which oppressed me in the strange surroundings . Whether it was because of the tasteless manner in which everything was arranged , because of the ugly furniture or the stuffy air , I do n't know , but I scarcely dared look around me anymore . The girl moved a chair . I sat down and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rubbed it . My fingers got warm from rubbing . I followed the lines of the design . Someplace on the edge there should be a burn hole which had never been repaired . \" My mother will be back very soon , \" said the girl . \" I had already made tea for her . Would you like a cup ? \" \" Please , \" I said . I looked up . The girl was setting out teacups on the tea table . She had a broad back . Just like her mother . She poured tea from a ## white pot . There was a gold edge just around the lid , I remembered . She opened a small box and took some teaspoons out of it . \" That 's a lovely little box . \" I heard my own voice . It was a strange voice . As though every sound in this room had another ring to it . \" Do you know much about that ? \" She had turned around and brought me my tea . She laughed . \" My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . \" She pointed around the room . \" Just look . \" I did n't need to follow her hand . I knew which things she meant . I kept looking at the still-life above the tea table . As a child I had always wanted to eat the apple that lay on the pewter plate . \" We use it for everything , \" she said . \" We 've even eaten from the plates which hang on the wall . I wanted to . But it was n't anything special . \" I had found the burn hole at the edge of the tablecloth . The girl looked at me inquiringly . \" Yes , \" I said , \" you get used to all these beautiful things at home , you hardly look at them anymore . You only notice when something is not there , because it has to be repaired , or , for example , because you 've lent it to someone . \" Again I heard the unnatural sound of my voice , and I continued : \" I remember my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was very long ago , and I must have been bored that day , or maybe I had to stay home because I was ill , for she had never asked me to do that before . I asked her which silver she meant , and she answered me , surprised , that she was of course talking about the spoons , forks , and knives . And that was of course the odd thing , I did n't know that the objects with which we ate every day were made of silver . \" The girl laughed again . \" I bet you do n't know that either , \" I said . I looked at her intently . \" What we eat with ? \" she asked . \" Well , do you know ? \" She hesitated . She walked to the buffet and started to pull open a drawer . \" I 'll have to look . It 's in here . \" I jumped up . \" I 'm forgetting my time . I still have to catch my train . \" She stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to wait for my mother ? \" \" No , I have to leave . \" I walked to the door . The girl opened the drawer . \" I 'll find my way . \" When I was walking through the hall I heard the clinking of spoons and forks . At the corner of the street I looked up at the nameplate . It said Marconistraat . I had been at Number 46 . The address was right . But ## now I no longer wanted to remember it . I would not go there again , for the objects which in your memory are linked with the familiar life of former times suddenly lose their value when you see them again , torn out of context , in strange surroundings . And what would I do with them in a small rented room in which shreds of blackout paper were still hanging along the windows and where in the narrow table drawer there was room for just a few dinner things ? I resolved to forget the address . Of all the things I should forget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \r\n##1001864 The Texas principessa Goyen , William Triquarterly ; Spring 1990 ; 78 ; Research Library ## The Texas Principessa William Goyen Who would 've dreamed that I would get the Palazzo ? Well let me try and stay on what you asked me about before we were so rudely interrupted ? by me . That ever happen to you ? Start out to tell one thing and get off onto another ? Well let me try and stay on what you asked me about . Welcome to the Palazzo . The Texas Principessa had married a Naples prince of an old line . Hortense Solomon ( we called her Horty ) was herself of an old line -- of dry-goods families . Texas Jews that had intermarried and built up large stores in Texas cities over the generations . Solomon 's Everybody 's Store was an everyday word in the mouths of Texas people and an emporium ? which was their word -- where Texas people were provided with everything from hosiery to clocks . The Solomons , along with the Linkowitzes , the Dinzlers and the Myrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their faith by traveling rabbis in early days , and later they built synagogues and contributed rabbis and cantors from their generations -- except those who married Texas Mexicans or Texas Frenchmen . These , after awhile , melted into the general mixture of the Texas population and ate cornbread instead of bagels and preferred barbecue pork and tamales to lox and herring . That ever happen to you ? Let 's see , where was I ? Oh . The Naples prince , Renzi da Filippo , did not bring much money to the marriage because the old line of da Filippos had used up most of it or lost it ; or had it taken from them in one way or another -- which was O.K. because they had taken it from somebody else earlier on : sometimes there is a little justice . That ever happen to you ? Renzi was the end of the line . Someone who was the end of a line would look it , would n't you think so ? You could not tell it in Renzi da Filippo , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handsome in that burnt ## blond coloring that they have , sort of toasted -- toast-colored hair and bluewater eyes and skin of a wheaty color . He was a beauty everyone said and was sought after in Rome and London and New York . Those Italianos ! About all he had in worldly goods was the beautiful Palazzo da Filippo in Venice , a seventeenth-century hunk of marble and gold that finally came into his hands . Had Hortense Solomon not given her vows to Renzi in wedlock , Palazzo da Filippo might have gone down the drain . It needed repair in the worst kind of way -- all those centuries on it -- and those repairs needed a small fortune -- which Horty had a lot of . As soon as the marriage was decided upon , there was a big party . The Prince was brought to Texas and an announcement party was thrown , and I mean thrown , on the cold ranch river that flowed through the acres and acres of hot cattleland owned by the Solomons . The gala stirred up socialites as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rich , famous and titled flew in on family planes . Horty Solomon ? which was very hard for Italians to say so they called her La Principessa di Texas -- started right in with her plans for fixing up the Palazzo . The plans were presented in the form of a little replica of the Palazzo used as a centerpiece for the sumptuous table . Two interior decorators called The Boys , favorites of Horty 's from Dallas , exhibited their color schemes -- a lot of Fuchsia for Horty loved this favorite color of hers . \" You 're certainly not going to redecorate that Palazzo \" ( they said Palazzo the way she did , so that it sounded like \" Plotso \" ) , \" you 're certainly not going to furnish it out of Solomon 's Everybody 's Store ! \" The Boys declared to Horty as soon as they heard of her plans to redo the Plotso da Filippo . \" Nor , \" said they , \" are you going to make it look like a West Texas ranch house . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuchsia appointments ! \" When Palazzo da Filippo was in shape , the Texas relatives poured in . The Palazzo was crawling with them , young and old . The Palazzo could have been a big Texas house . Black cooks and maids from East Texas mingled with Italian servants . The Venetians loved it . \" Viva la Principessa di Texas ! \" they cried . Those Italianos ! Here I must inform you something of which you were asking about , that on his very wedding night in a villa in Monaco ( the beautiful Prince gambled on his wedding night ) the beautiful Prince Renzi burst a blood vessel in his inner ear and succumbed ( the newspapers ' word for it ) . He just plain died in his wedding bed is what it was . You were asking about how he died . Vicious talk had it that the only stain on the nuptial ( newspapers ' word ) ? only stain on the nuptial sheets came from the Prince 's ear . Crude . The poor bride , who had been married before -- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned . Poor Horty . Tragedy dogged her , as you well can see . I myself have never experienced the death of a husband but I have experienced two divorces and let me tell you they are similar , they are like a death . They are no fun . My last divorce was particularly nasty . Thank God there was no issue , as the Wills said . Both my husbands were without issue . Issue indeed . That 's a joke for the last one , who issued it to Old Granddad instead of me -- mind as well say it ; and excuse the profanity -- that one had little issue except through his mouth . . . when he threw up his Bourbon . Crude , I know . But that 's mainly the kind of issue he had . That ever happen to you ? Let 's see where was I. Oh . Anyway , this left me in London , quite penniless ; tell you why I was in London some other time . Do n't have time for that garden path now -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a detour from . But the thing of it is , this is how Horty Solomon got the Palazzo da Filippo , which is what you were asking me about : under the auspices of a sad circumstance -- a broken blood vessel leading to death ; but a tragedy leading to a new life for her . And for me , as you will soon hear the story ( that you were asking about ) . Anyway , Horty went on with her plans for the Palazzo , now all hers . As I said somewhere -- I ca n't tell a story straight to save my life , my mind races off onto a hundred things that I remember and want to tell right then , do n't want to wait . That ever happen to you ? Anyway , as I said somewhere , Texans flooded into the canals of Venice because of the Principessa : Venezia was half Texas some days -- and loved it . And if you 've ever heard a Texan speaking Italian , you wo n't believe the sound of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football players ? Horty had given them a stadium in Lampasas ( they called her Cousin Horty ) ? Junior League ladies , student concert pianists ( Horty was a patron of the Arts , as you will see more about ) , and once a Rock group ? they had that Grand Canal jumping , and some seventeenth-century tiles fell , I can tell you . And maybe something from even earlier , a Fresco or two from the Middle Ages . And talented young people who wanted to paint or write came over to the Palazzo , to write in or paint in , or practice a musical instrument in ; and they accepted . See what she did ? Palazzo da Filippo jived , that was the word then ; it was in the nineteenfifties . That joint jumped , as they said . I said back there that I was going to tell you why I was in London . Or did I ? Ca n't remember . Just try to remember something with all this noise around here . Italians are noisy , sweet as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where was I ? Oh . London . Well , forget London for the time being -- if I have n't already told it to you . Just keep ## London in the back of your mind . Now where was I ? Oh . Well , you have asked me to tell you what you are hearing -- the story of the Texas Principessa , my old schoolmate and lifelong pal , that you asked about . After the Prince 's death , Horty pulled herself together and got the Palazzo together -- a reproduction of Palazzo da Filippo was engraved on Renzi 's tombstone with Horty 's changes incorporated ( which , of course , I thought was rather nifty , would n't you ) ? and Horty pleaded with me in April by phone and cable to come stay . \" Come and stay as long as you want to , stay forever if you 're happy in the Palazzo ; just come on , \" Horty said , long distance , to me in London . Horty loved to have people in the house . This does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I 've seen it happen that a motorboat would arrive and disburse a dozen guests and a week later depart with the same guests and not one of them had ever seen the Principessa . Horty would 've confined herself off in her own apartment in the far right top wing and there remain in privacy . Simply did not want to have anything to do with them , with her guests . \" That 's Horty , \" everyone said . They 'd had a grand time , gone in the Principessa 's private motorboats to Torcello , to lunch at the Cipriano , to cocktails at other palazzos , been served divine dinners with famous Italians at the da Filippo . But no Horty . She usually -- she was so generous -- gave expensive presents to her guests to get them to forgive her . Once she gave everybody an egg -- a sixth-century -- B.c. ! ? egg of Chinese jade . Amounted to about a dozen eggs . Somebody said the retail value of those eggs was about one hundred and fifty dollars apiece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April and May I came . Horty at once announced to me that there was no room for me at the Palazzo ! She was getting crazy over painters . She 'd become more and more interested in painting , Horty did , but that 's no surprise because she always seemed to possess a natural eye and feeling for painting , not so curious for an heiress to generations of garment salesmen , even though you might so comment . For Hortense Solomon inherited good taste and a tendency for her eye to catch fine things when she saw them . Though there were Brahma bulls leering through the windows of the Solomon ranch in West Texas , what those bulls saw inside was fine china and Chippendale , silver and crystal and satin and silk . Those bulls saw the handiwork of a chic decorator and an elegant collector ; not every bull sees that . So a seventeenth-century palazzo in Venice was not so far a cry for Horty to fix up . Well , here was I living over at the Cipriano where Horty , who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banished me -- to a terrific suite , I ## must say , and footed by her -- and here was I coming across the Canal every day to observe the goings on at the Palazzo . Frankly I was glad to have me a little distance from the commotion . Well-known artists came to live in the Palazzo da Filippo and to set up studios there and in the environs . Horty patronized them . Gave them scholarships as she called them . A few were very attractive , I must say , some very young -- Horty 's eye again . The Venetians adored La Principessa di Texas . They appreciated her for unscrewing the horse 's outfit from the horse sculpture in her garden on the Grand Canal when the Archbishop passed in his barge on days of Holy Procession . The Principessa had commissioned the sculpture of a beautiful horse possesed of some wild spirit , with a head uplifted and long mouth open in an outcry . On it sat a naked man , again possessed of some wild spirit , seemed like , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You did not see the rider 's outfit but the horse 's was very apparent , and the Principessa commissioned the sculptor -- a then-unknown but handsome sculptor -- to sculpt one that was removable . Which seems to apply to a lot of men that I have known -- where was it ? A lot of them seem to have removed it . Put it in a drawer someplace . Or mind as well have . Where was I ? Oh yes . The horses 's outfit . On high holy procession days the Texas Principessa could be seen on her knees under the belly of the horse with grasping hands , making wrenching movements . The Italians coined a phrase for it . When they saw her going at the horse as if she were twisting a light globe , they said to each other that La Principessa di Texas was \" honoring the Archbishop . \" The community generally appreciated her decency for doing this ; some felt that the Archbishop should give her a citation . And a few called her a castrator -- in Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right but you know what I mean ; and of course a few from home in Texas said she was a dicktwister -- had to put their nasty mouths into it . Crude . Where was I ? Oh . An American painter came to visit Horty one afternoon . He was showing in the Biennale , which is what they call the show of paintings that they have every year . Horty and the painter drank and talked about his painting . When the Principessa turned around from making another double martini for the American painter -- she hardly gave it to him when she had to whirl around and make another one -- pirouette is what you had to do when you made drinks for that man . Unless you just made a whole jug and gave it to him . Anyway , she whirled to find him urinating in the fireplace . The Principessa was so impressed with the American painter -- imagine the audacity ! ? that famous summer afternoon that she asked him to stay . He stayed -- over a year , it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings in the Palazzo gallery ; they have become very sought-after and the painter very famous -- though dead from alcoholism not so many years after that . More proof of the ability of discovery that the Principessa had , which is what an article about her recently said . And of the tragic cloud that kept lurking over her life . Even with all her money and the good that she did people , that cloud lurked . And of course it got her , as you well know . Because Horty 's dead . As you well know . Which is what I started out to tell you the details about when you asked me . Well , it was when we were lunching on the terrazzo of the Palazzo . One of those gold June days that Venice has . I 'll go right into it and not dwell on it : Horty was bitten by something , some kind of terrible spider , and blood poisoning killed her before we knew it . Guess where the spider was ? In a peach . Living at the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchards of the Meditteranean . Horty cried out and fainted . We 'd all had a lot of champagne . By the time we got her to the hospital she was dead . Doctor said it was rank poison and that Horty was wildly allergic to it . When she broke the peach open out sprung the horrible black spider . I saw it in a flash . And before she knew it , it had stung her into the bloodstream of her thigh , right through pure silk Italian brocade . I 'll never eat a peach again , I 'll tell you . All Venice was upset . The Archbishop conducted the funeral himself . Horty 'd left quite a few lire to the Church . We forgot to unscrew the horse 's outfit , but when the funeral procession passed by , all the gondoliers took off their hats . Those Italianos ! And I am the new Principessa -- except of course I am not a Principessa . But the Italians insist on calling me the new Principessa . The Palazzo is mine . Who ever dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opened back in Texas they read where Horty had given the place to me ! I almost had a heart attack . The will said \" to my best friend . \" But what in the world will I do with a Palazzo ? I said . I have not the vast fortune that Horty had . But you have all the paintings of the famous dead American , they said . Sure , the family have all fought me for the paintings of the dead American painter . Just let somebody find something good and everybody else tries to get it . Like a bunch of ants . That ever happen to you ? They could n't care less about the Palazzo . But the paintings are something else . The Museum has offered half a million dollars for one . I will not sell yet . And that man that peed in the fire died drunk and broke . Ever hear of such a thing ? But they say the pollution is just eating up the paintings . And the Palazzo . So far I 'm safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town is sinking . Venice is a ## little lopsided . I do n't know where to go . I hardly know how I got here . Sometimes I think , who am I , where am I ? That ever happen to you ? But the Texas Principessa is a saint in Venezia . Better not say anything in this town against Horty , I 'm telling you . Those Italianos speak her name with reverence and the Archbishop says her name a lot in church . I have offered the horse to the Church , without outfit , but the Archbishop suggested -- he 's so cute , with a twinkle in his eyes , those Italianos ! ? the Archbishop suggested that it cavallo stay where it is . Because it is an affectionate monument for the townspeople , particularly the gondoliers . They point it out to tourists . I hear they 're selling little replicas near the Vatican . The sculptor is very upset . He 's made many more sculptures ( not of horses ) but nobody ever paid much attention to any of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives all crazy ? Some days I ca n't believe any of it . Sometimes I want to go home but I hear Texas is just as crazy . Anyway , that 's the story of Horty Solomon da Filippo , the Texas Principessa . Which is what you asked me about , is n't it ? But one more thing . Next morning after the funeral I saw below the terrazzo something sparkling in the dew , something pure silver with diamonds and rubies and emeralds -- like something Horty would 've worn -- and I saw that it was a gorgeous web . And there in the center , all alone , was the horrible black insect that I am sure was the one that had lived at the heart of the peach that killed the Texas Principessa and brought the Palazzo to me . How could something so ugly and of death make something like that . . . so beautiful ? I had the oddest feeling , ca n't describe it . That ever happen to you ? Well , that 's the story , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \r\n##1001872 My mother is the surviving half of a blindfold trapeze act , not a fact I think about much even now that she is sightless , the result of encroaching and stubborn cataracts . She walks slowly through her house here in New Hampshire , lightly touching her way along walls and running her hands over knickknacks , books , the drift of a grown child 's belongings and castoffs . She has never upset an object or as much as brushed a magazine onto the floor . She has never lost her balance or bumped into a closet door left carelessly open . It has occurred to me that the catlike precision of her movements in old age might be the result of her early training , but she shows so little of the drama or flair one might expect from a performer that I tend to forget the Flying AvaIons . She has kept no sequined costume , no photographs , no fliers or posters from that part of her youth . I would , in fact , tend to think that all memory of double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were it not for the fact that sometimes , as I sit sewing in the room of the rebuilt house in which I slept as a child , I hear the crackle , catch a whiff of smoke from the stove downstairs , and suddenly the room goes dark , the stitches bum beneath my fingers , and I am sewing with a needle of hot silver , a thread of fire . I owe her my existence three times . The first was when she saved herself . In the town square a replica tent pole , cracked and splintered , now stands cast in concrete . It commemorates the disaster that put our town smack on the front page of the Boston and New York tabloids . It is from those old newspapers , now historical records , that I get my information . Not from my mother , Anna of the Flying Avalons , nor from any of her in-laws , nor certainly from the other half of her particular act , Harold Avalon , her first husband . In one news account it says , \" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or temperature gave any hint of the sudden force with which the deadly gale would strike . \" I have lived in the West , where you can see the weather coming for miles , and it is true that out here we are at something of a disadvantage . When extremes of temperature collide , a hot and cold front , winds generate instantaneously behind a hill and crash upon you without warning . That , I think , was the likely situation on that day in June . People probably commented on the pleasant air , grateful that no hot sun beat upon the striped tent that stretched over the entire center green . They bought their tickets and surrendered them in anticipation . They sat . They ate caramelized popcorn and roasted peanuts . There was time , before the storm , for three acts . The White Arabians of Ali-Khazar rose on their hind legs and waltzed . The Mysterious Bernie folded himself into a painted cracker tin , and the Lady of the Mists made herself appear and disappear in surprising places . As the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shouted his introduction , and pointed to the ceiling of the tent , where the Flying Avalons were perched . They loved to drop gracefully from nowhere , like two sparkling birds , and blow kisses as they threw off their plumed helmets and high-collared capes . They laughed and flirted openly as they beat their way up again on the trapeze bars . In the final vignette of their act , they actually would kiss in midair , pausing , almost hovering as they swooped past one another . On the ground , between bows , Harry Avalon would skip quickly to the front rows and point out the smear of my mother 's lipstick , just off the edge of his mouth . They made a romantic pair all right , especially in the blindfold sequence . That afternoon , as the anticipation increased , as Mr. and Mrs. Avalon tied sparkling strips of cloth onto each other 's face and as they puckered their lips in mock kisses , lips destined \" never again to meet , \" as one long breathless article put it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone , and howled . There came a rumble of electrical energy , drowned out by the sudden roll of drums . One detail not mentioned by the press , perhaps unknown-Anna was pregnant at the time , seven months and hardly showing , her stomach muscles were that strong . It seems incredible that she would work high above the ground when any fall could be so dangerous , but the explanation-I know from watching her go blind-is that my mother lives comfortably in extreme elements . She is one with the constant dark now , just as the air was her home , familiar to her , safe , before the storm that afternoon . From opposite ends of the tent they waved , blind and smiling , to the crowd below . The ringmaster removed his hat and called for silence , so that the two above could concentrate . They rubbed their hands in chalky powder , then Harry launched himself and swung , once , twice , in huge calibrated beats across space . He hung from his knees and on the third swing stretched wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant wife as she dove from her shining bar . It was while the two were in midair , their hands about to meet , that lightning struck the main pole and sizzled down the guy wires , filling the air with a blue radiance that Harry Avalon must certainly have seen through the cloth of his blindfold as the tent buckled and the edifice toppled him forward , the swing continuing and not returning in its sweep , and Harry going down , down into the crowd with his last thought , perhaps , just a prickle of surprise at his empty hands . My mother once said that I 'd be amazed at how many things a person can do within the act of falling . Perhaps , at the time , she was teaching me to dive off a board at the town pool , for I associate the idea with midair somersaults . But I also think she meant that even in that awful doomed second one could think , for she certainly did . When her hands did not meet her husband 's , my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wrong side , she could have grasped his ankle , the toe-end of his tights , and gone down clutching him . Instead , she changed direction . Her body twisted toward a heavy wire and she managed to hang on to the braided metal , still hot from the lightning strike . Her palms were burned so terribly that once healed they bore no lines , only the blank scar tissue of a quieter future . She was lowered , gently , to the sawdust ring just underneath the dome of the canvas roof , which did not entirely settle but was held up on one end and jabbed through , torn , and still on fire in places from the giant spark , though rain and men 's jackets soon put that out . Three people died , but except for her hands my mother was not seriously harmed until an overeager rescuer broke her arm in extricating her and also , in the process , collapsed a portion of the tent bearing a huge buckle that knocked her unconscious . She was taken to the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they kept her , confined to her bed , a month and a half before her baby was born without life . Harry Avalon had wanted to be buried in the circus cemetery next to the original Avalon , his uncle , so she sent him back with his brothers . The child , however , is buried around the corner , beyond this house and just down the highway . Sometimes I used to walk there just to sit . She was a girl , but I rarely thought of her as a sister or even as a separate person really . I suppose you could call it the egocentrism of a child , of all young children , but I considered her a less finished version of myself . When the snow falls , throwing shadows among the stones , I can easily pick hers out from the road , for it is bigger than the others and in the shape of a lamb at rest , its legs curled beneath . The carved lamb looms larger as the years pass , though it is probably only my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me blurs and distances sharpen . In odd moments , I think it is the edge drawing near , the edge of everything , the unseen horizon we do not really speak of in the eastern woods . And it also seems to me , although this is probably an idle fantasy , that the statue is growing more sharply etched , as if , instead of weathering itself into a porous mass , it is hardening on the hillside with each snowfall , perfecting itself . It was during her confinement in the hospital that my mother met my father . He was called in to look at the set of her arm , which was complicated . He stayed , sitting at her bedside , for he was something of an armchair traveler and had spent his war quietly , at an air force training grounds , where he became a specialist in arms and legs broken during parachute training exercises . Anna Avalon had been to many of the places he longed to visit-Venice , Rome , Mexico , all through France and Spain . She had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avalons , trained to perform from a very I wonder if my father calculated the exchange he offered : one form of flight for another . For after that , and for as long as I can remember , my mother has never been without a book . Until now , that is , and it remains the greatest difficulty of her blindness . Since my father 's recent death , there is no one to read to her , which is why I returned , in fact , from my failed life young age . They toured Europe before the war , then based themselves in New York . She was illiterate . It was in the hospital that she finally learned to read and write , as a way of overcoming the boredom and depression of those weeks , and it was my father who insisted on teaching her . In return for stories of her adventures , he graded her first exercises . He bought her her first book , and over her bold letters , which the pale guides of the penmanship pads could not contain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I came home to read to my mother , to read out loud , to read long into the dark if I must , to read all night . Once my father and mother married , they moved onto the old farm he had inherited but did n't care much for . Though he 'd been thinking of moving to a larger city , he settled down and broadened his practice in this valley . It still seems odd to me , when they could have gone anywhere else , that they chose to stay in the town where the disaster had occurred , and which my father in the first place had found so constricting . It was my mother who insisted upon it , after her child did not survive . And then , too , she loved the sagging farmhouse with its scrap of what was left of a vast acreage of woods and hidden hay fields that stretched to the game park . I owe my existence , the second time then , to the two of them and the hospital that brought them together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us asks for life . It is only once we have it that we hang on so dearly . I was seven the year the house caught fire , probably from standing ash . It can rekindle , and my father , forgetful around the house and perpetually exhausted from night hours on call , often emptied what he thought were ashes from cold stoves into wooden or cardboard containers . The fire could have started from a flaming box , or perhaps a buildup of creosote inside the chimney was the culprit . It started right around the stove , and the heart of the house was gutted . The baby-sitter , fallen asleep in my father 's den on the first floor , woke to find the stairway to my upstairs room cut off by flames . She used the phone , then ran outside to stand beneath my window . When my parents arrived , the town volunteers had drawn water from the fire pond and were spraying the outside of the house , preparing to go inside after me , not knowing at the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other side of the house , the superannuated extension ladder broke in half . Perhaps the clatter of it falling against the walls woke me , for I 'd been asleep up to that point . As soon as I awakened , in the small room that I now use for sewing , I smelled the smoke . I followed things by the letter then , was good at memorizing instructions , and so I did exactly what was taught in the second-grade home fire drill . I got up , I touched the back of my door before opening it . Finding it hot , I left it closed and stuffed my rolled-up rug beneath the crack . I did not hide under my bed or crawl into my closet . I put on my flannel robe , and then I sat down to wait . Outside , my mother stood below my dark window and saw clearly that there was no rescue . Flames had pierced one side wall , and the glare of the fire lighted the massive limbs and trunk of the vigorous old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built , a hundred years ago at least . No leaf touched the wall , and just one thin branch scraped the roof . From below , it looked as though even a squirrel would have had trouble jumping from the tree onto the house , for the breadth of that small branch was no bigger than my mother 's wrist . Standing there , beside Father , who was preparing to rush back around to the front of the house , my mother asked him to unzip her dress . When he would n't be bothered , she made him understand . He could n't make his hands work , so she finally tore it off and stood there in her pearls and stockings . She directed one of the men to lean the broken half of the extension ladder up against the trunk of the tree . In surprise , he complied . She ascended . She vanished . Then she could be seen among the leafless branches of late November as she made her way up and , along her stomach , inched the length of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once there , swaying , she stood and balanced . There were plenty of people in the crowd and many who still remember , or think they do , my mother 's leap through the ice-dark air toward that thinnest extension , and how she broke the branch falling so that it cracked in her hands , cracked louder than the flames as she vaulted with it toward the edge of the roof , and how it hurtled down end over end without her , and their eyes went up , again , to see where she had flown . I did n't see her leap through air , only heard the sudden thump and looked out my window . She was hanging by the backs of her heels from the new gutter we had put in that year , and she was smiling . I was not surprised to see her , she was so matter-of-fact . She tapped on the window . I remember how she did it , too . It was the friendliest tap , a bit tentative , as if she was afraid she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gestured at the latch , and when I opened the window she told me to raise it wider and prop it up with the stick so it would n't crush her fingers . She swung down , caught the ledge , and crawled through the opening . Once she was in my room , I realized she had on only underclothing , a bra of the heavy stitched cotton women used to wear and step-in , lace-trimmed drawers . I remember feeling light-headed , of course , terribly relieved , and then embarrassed for her to be seen by the crowd undressed . I was still embarrassed as we flew out the window , toward earth , me in her lap , her toes pointed as we skimmed toward the painted target of the fire fighter 's net . I know that she 's right . I knew it even then . As you fall there is time to think . Curled as I was , against her stomach , I was not startled by the cries of the crowd or the looming faces . The wind roared and beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I slowly wondered what would happen if we missed the circle or bounced out of it . Then I wrapped my hands around my mother 's hands . I felt the brush of her lips and heard the beat of her heart in my ears , loud as thunder , long as the roll of drums . ", "\r\n##1002054 Beyond the Garden <p> He knew he wanted to taste to that fruit as badly as she did . On his own , he would have come round to it in time , terrified though he was by his father 's commands . But since her arrival , he had lost the habit of fetching his own food . Instinctively , it seemed , she gave him part of whatever fruits she picked for herself , till it came to seem instinctive in him to wait . ( Besides , he enjoyed watching her climb the trees . ) Very possibly , he admitted in the privacy of his heart , he had been waiting for that very fruit . <p> So from the moment he betrayed her to his father - the thundering , awesome voice that must come from an equally awesome shape , or shamelessness - he felt slightly ashamed , an unfamiliar , unwelcome feeling . Ashamed not of eating but of the telling . Of course his father would have found out ( he knew everything yet seemed to relish humiliating him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifty guilt each time he looked at her or touched her , a guilt more particular and acute than a vague , encompassing guilt he felt in his father 's presence . And she certainly did n't make things any easier : Docile acceptance was not in her nature , in the beginning , at any rate . She railed and stormed about loyalty , and said being a helpmeet worked both ways , he utterly failed to understand her being with him and all it implied .... Like his father , she had words at her command , piercingly direct words , and the more she spoke the worse he felt . <p> Well , let her complain . There were things she could n't begin to comprehend . What it was to have such a father , for one . How would she like to have awakened , all alone , to the sound of a voice that covered you like a tide , that could n't for a moment let you forget it was the source , that whatever you did and used and enjoyed came from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was abundantly clear where she came from ( it was going a bit far , he thought sullenly , to remove his rib while he innocently slept - you 'd think a man could call his body his own ) , his ambiguous origins made him uneasy . That the voice was his father , everything 's father , was plain enough . Yet he was told too that he came from a handful of dust . Hardly reassuring to be made of dust . At the moments of his greatest strength , when he sported with the animals or swam across the stream , he would suddenly remember , Dust , and shiver with intimations of crumbling , dissolving . And could she feel how heavy a burden it was to live up to his father 's image ? For those were the cryptic words he must live by - made in his image - yet how could a creature of dust aspire to such grandeur ? By constant striving and self-discipline , that was how ; by measuring every action against the example of that mighty voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her view , he worried far too much over his relation to his father . Why not concentrate instead on his relation to her , a notion that struck him as sacrilege . She just was n't important enough in the scheme of things , delightful as it might be to play with her and end up , more often than not , in an embrace . Did his father indulge in such lush joys ? Inconceivable . Well , it was one thing to yield briefly , which was no doubt what his father had intended , and quiet another to take it seriously : hardly in that sober image . <p> So he had heeded his father 's voice and told the truth , as he was taught to do ( if threats were a valid form of teaching ) , and they were cast out of the garden to a colder , craggier place , where he could never hear the voice approach without anxious trembling . They were poor , as warned , but the work did not trouble him - in truth , the idleness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suspect he was made for more than leisure , that he had the resources to achieve something , perhaps great things . Look at all his father had done ! Surely if he was made in his image , he might accomplish something by his labor . If work was his curse he was prepared to endure it , even enjoy it . <p> He did n't grasp the nature of her curse until he saw it enacted . Here was no curse but a blessing . Of all the stupendous things , of all the examples of his father 's inventiveness , this was the most miraculous . She heaved and moaned and tossed while he , standing helplessly by , thought at first that it must be Death , so far only a baffling , dread word . At last , out of all her heaving , came another exactly like him . Her wails stopped immediately and she laughed in astonishment . But something nagged at his own astonished joy . Why had his father given this great power to her ? Could she possibly be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust and she of firmer stuff ? As for the child , it had what neither of them had ever known , a mother . Everyone - father , wife , child , seemed more privileged than he , mere dust and motherless . All that distinguished him were his strength and his will to work . <p> The next year there was another like him , and he marveled anew . The others were like her ; perhaps for that reason he did not note them down in the records he had begun to keep , or perhaps it no longer seemed so miraculous . Besides , he began to have the discouraging feeling that they belonged more to her than to him , what with her carrying them and nursing them and the long hours spent in their company while he was at work . He sensed her gradually turning away from him and toward them . She still came to him when he wanted her , but not with exclusive attention ; it was possible she loved them more . And just as these thoughts came to trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was he who discovered them , and who heard the older one saying those unimaginable , unforgivable words to the great voice , which thundered more terrifyingly now than when they had left the garden ages ago . When it finally withdrew , leaving him to gaze at his sons , on one defiant , confused , and ashamed , the other a mangled body on the grass , he understood he had lost them both forever . He grieved mightily , his first wrenching grief . He grieved , yet having known resentment and frustration , he saw dimly how a man might strike out with dumb force . <p> He grieved and mourned them both , but her grief was inconsolable . Once so lavish with words , now she had none to hold what she felt . Anger , spite , deceit , yes , she was familiar with many ugly things by now , but this was beyond her grasp . The life oozed out of her as it had out of the boy , though she still breathed and moved . She lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? she replied when he tried to rouse her . And seeing her grown older and sad beyond reach , he knew there would be no more children ; that power had left her , or else the will to use it . <p> No one remained but his daughters , who looked almost as she had when she first appeared . Up to this moment he had regarded them simply as tender children to take care of , who could help with the work when they grew strong enough . Now , with unease , he found himself watching as they moved through the house or the fields , precisely as he had once watched her , bewitched by every nuance of contour and movement . Would it be so very wrong ? It was nothing his father had specifically forbidden . On the contrary , had n't he ordered them to be fruitful and multiply ? <p> In time he bred a long line of sons and daughters , whose vices multiplied with their numbers . After her shock at the first brutal act , none of it surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with mute disapproval . She did not often rebel at the way things went - but her silence was worse than her occasional open rebellion . Her silence haunted him , and her yielding , with its tacit skepticism , he found unbearable : His own skepticism was hard enough to bear . <p> Her silence cast it pall over the numberless projects absorbing his every waking hour . For his talent , he had discovered over many seasons , was for invention : He made machines - massive and powerful , delicate and intricate - that could perform miracles never dreamed of in the garden . Perhaps even his father had never dreamed of them , although that was hard to say : He was no longer in close touch with his father , speaking to him only with unavoidable , and in a perfunctory way . Strange to say , his father seemed content to do the same . <p> The machines could control the elements , channel water , cut through rock , and tear through sky . They were his whole delight , they swelled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own body . He learned she had not accomplished that first miracle , ages back , no her own . She could never have done it without hi , . The discovery made him look on her with a kind of contempt , a satisfying contempt that eased his secret doubts and timidities . It was a relief to feel it , for he had been eaten by envy from the start , or at least from the moment he knew the shame of betraying her . Now the shame had found a safe casing ; it could be sealed in contempt like a bitter nut in its shell . <p> In his new arrogance , he was willing enough to cede to her the domestic sphere , so lacking in grandeur . But after much thought , he decided that even there , it was his part to invent the machinery and hers to operate it , under his guidance . Such an arrangement , he reasoned , was more or less similar to the way the babies were produced . It was , come to think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How pleased he was to have solved the riddle of how to live up the image after all , and how laughably easy it was . The solution had been there all along - to treat her as his father had treated him . <p> His program worked in disconcerting ways , though , perhaps because he was not his father but only an image . He invented countless things to save her travail , but since he never attempted to use them , he found himself at her mercy - waiting for her to prepare his food and stitch his clothes , keep his worldly affairs in order and educate the children in his own image . From the largest matter down to the lowliest ice-cube tray , for instance , whose cubes he awaited for her to extract - he felt powerless . And exasperated , no matter how efficiently she went about her business . Indeed , the more efficient she was , the more he was exasperated . <p> There was only one thing to do . Tentatively , in secret , he approached the machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures . And he found that with practice and application , with patience of a sort he had believed , contemptuously , was patience of a sort he had believed , contemptuously , was alone and a slavish virtue , he was able to fend for himself , to handle his affairs as well as have food and clean clothes at his pleasure ; he could even wheel the babies in their carriages and teach them what they needed to know . By his own humble efforts he could do all manner of extraordinary things . <p> And thus Adam , though he would never free himself of the giant shadow of his father 's image , at least managed to free himself from the skills of Eve . Once this happened , she began to glance at him with a keener interest , for she too had long nursed a mute contempt for his theories , his evasions . She still could not countenance what he sanctioned in his sons , and she would never care much for his father 's treats and bravado , but since he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed him , and grew spirited and beautiful once again . <p> Illustration ( The Fall of Man , 12th century Byzantine illumination ) <p> \r\n##1002058 This Thing Between Men and Women <p> \" He said he 'd pay a dollar an hour , \" my mother coaxes . \" While Marie 's on her honeymoon , he just has to have some help with the store . \" <p> \" What about his other girl , what's-her-name ? \" <p> \" Oh Colleen could n't stay alone in the house with Sam while Marie is gone .

His knuckles are red and puffy . I think of all the money he borrowed from Sam Dugas . <p> The store itself is only slightly larger than our living room ; I had expected something huge and extravagant .

His white shirt is open at the collar and his sleeves are rolled up . A faint smell of spicy cologne drifts over from his neck . <p> \" When the kids come in to buy candy , watch them , \" Sam tells me . \" Sometimes they put things in their pockets \" -- \" tings , \" he says , der pockets . \" He looks down at me through the bottom half of his bifocals and winks , as if it 's a game to catch them at it . <p> I like Sam more today , I decide , watching him bustle around his store , adjusting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . <p> \" I got some business to take care of , I 'll be back later , \" he tells me midmorning , and I wonder if he is going to see my mother . A few times times a week he parks his big white Pontiac right by the fire hydrant in front of our house . \" I was just passing by and thought I 'd drop in and say hello , \" he says , rattling the keys in his pocket and grinning like a porpoise . \" Come in , come in , \" my mother brightens , hurrying off her apron . \" No , I ca n't stay , \" he says , \" I 'm parked in front of the hydrant . \" <p> Sometimes he takes my mother for rides .

It was boring . <p> From behind me , through the partially open door that leads to Sam 's house , I can hear two female voices . I look in now and then , curious to see the two sisters , one of whom is about to marry a sailor . I can tell right away which is the bride . She 's plump and has thick legs and thin , curly permed hair . Her sister looks at her with great cow-eyes . I wonder what it would be like to live in someone else 's house , cooking and cleaning , taking care of someone else 's store . <p> At noon Sam comes in for a few minutes -- \" How are things going ? \" -- then goes back out . The bride 's sister brings me an egg salad sandwich and a glass of milk . \" If it gets right busy , just yell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" Her hands are large , and a film of dark hair covers her arms . When she goes back into the house , she doses the door behind her . <p> All afternoon the customers come , in twos and threes . Little boys wanting a loaf of bread or a pound of baloney . Their hands hover over the penny candy , treading the air like hummingbirds . I hold them back with my eyes . The middle-aged women ask : \" Are you the new girl ? \" and smile and call me dear . <p> Then he comes in . He stares at me from the corners of the store until everyone else is gone . <p> \" So , \" he says , leaning a tanned arm on the counter . \" Sam has a new helper . \" <p> I nod . <p> \" I 'm glad he decided to get a pretty one for a change , \" he says , moving his eyes over me . The r 's on his tongue roll like a purr and the words , the strange way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges . <p> I lean back on my stool and shrug , giving him a closed-lip smile . <p> \" What 's your name ? \" he asks , leaning farther toward me . His hair and eyes are brown like chestnuts , and I am trying to figure out what he wants . Perhaps he has a gun and wants to steal the money in my register . <p> \" Nicole , \" I tell him , \" What 's yours ? \" That way I can tell the police later , if I have to . <p> \" Steffan , \" he says , smiling broadly , pleased that I asked . \" Well little Nicole , do you have a boyfriend ? \" <p> I fold my arms in front of my chest and lie : \" Yes , lots of them . \" <p> \" Lots of them , \" he repeats , rolling his eyes . \" And do you let them kiss you ? \" He says kiss as if it had five s 's , curling his lips forward as if he is kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \" I tell him . <p> He laughs . Throws his head back and laughs from somewhere deep in his chest . His hands , resting on the counter , have long slim fingers . Piano hands , Mother Murphy at school would call them . \" Oh you 're a frisky one , \" he says , still laughing . \" I 'll bet they have a good time with you . \" <p> Two old ladies come in then , followed by a girl and her younger brother . Somewhere between wrapping a soup bone for the old ladies and helping the little boy pick out five cents worth of penny candy , I notice that he has gone . <p> In a little while , Sam appears . He unpacks a box of potato chips and rearranges the candy counter . <p> \" How did things go ? \" <p> \" Fine . \" I do n't tell him about the man . <p> The next day Sam meets me at the store wearing a dark blue suit . \" The reception 's right after mass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . \" He smells intensely of cologne and fidgets with the cans of salmon and haddock . <p> The door to the house is still closed . I picture a table with a heavy white cloth , a tall wedding cake in the center , plates of dainty sandwiches surrounding it . And I imagine Colleen and Marie in some corner bedroom , Colleen zipping up the back of her sister 's wedding dress . I wonder what it would be like to be a bride , putting on clean underwear , hooking my stockings on to my garters on the morning of my wedding . <p> Around noon the room behind the door floods with thick rustlings and muffled voices . Sam pops into the store , and the door drifts open behind him . I catch a glimpse of Marie . Her face is pink and soft , and her eyes are shining . She looks pretty , I think , with her white dress and lacy hat .

A lot of cars start up all at once , then the house gets quiet . <p> \" Did you see Marie ? \" my mother asks , when I get home . \" Did she look nice ? \" \" Yes , \" I say . <p> \" Sam dropped by for a minute after they 'd all gone . He told me it went well . \" <p> I picture Sam and my mother standing in the doorway , discussing Marie 's wedding .

He leans toward her as he talks , the corners of his thick mouth fluttering foolishly . <p> On Monday afternoon the store is quiet . Around four o'clock , he comes in . He studies the labels on the soup cans until the woman with the two children leaves . <p> \" And how is my pretty little Nicole today ? \" he asks . <p> \" I 'm just fine , \" I answer . \" But I 'm not your little anything . \" <p> \" Oh but I wish you were , \" he says , leaning so far over the counter that I can feel his breath . I am suddenly aware that there is no one home next door . <p> \" You 'd be so much more fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks at me smiling , inviting me to ask . <p> \" Oh ? \" I try not to look too interested . <p> \" She 's around twenty , fiery like you but not as sweet . \" He says sweet the way he said kiss the time before , holding the word in his mouth like a piece of hard candy . \" She was nice for a while , but then she bit me . \" He points to a bluish mark on his bottom lip . \" Can you imagine that ? \" <p> For some reason this strikes me as enormously funny . I start to laugh . <p> \" You would n't do that though , would you ? \" <p> I ca n't stop laughing . I look at the blue mark on his lip and the laughter ripples up and down my spine , my legs . <p> \" Would you ? \" His left eyebrow arches into a question mark . <p> At six , Sam comes back and closes the store for a while to take me home . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . \" I can save you that long bus ride . \" <p> He opens the door of his Pontiac to let me in , then shuts it behind me . Inside it 's all red and smells of leather . Music bubbles softly from the radio and the car feels hushed and cozy , like the inside of a confessional . <p> \" So how do you like working in the store ? \" Sam asks . <p> \" I like it fine . You were right about the little boys , though . \" <p> \" What do you mean ? \" <p> \" Their hands . You have to watch their hands . \" <p> Sam laughs . His mouth falls open and his whole body jiggles . <p> \" Your mother told me you 'd be a good worker and she was right . \" He looks at me out of the corner of his eye to see my reaction . I think of my mother , sitting where I am sitting , next to Sam in all this cozy redness . It seems different today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother really likes your car , \" I tell Sam . \" She likes it when you take her for rides . \" <p> Sam 's mouth twitches in pleasure . His eyes shine behind his glasses . \" A woman as beautiful as your mother deserves some fun now and then . She 's a good woman to stand by your father during all his troubles . \" I picture my mother standing beside my father . Then I see her where I am now , riding in the big white Pontiac , her voice tinkling like little bells . <p> The next few days are the same . My father and one of the boys bring me over in the truck . Sam pops in and out . At noon he brings me fish and chips from Willman 's . Late in the afternoon , he appears . When people come in he goes to the shelves and examines labels ; after they leave he leans on the counter and tells me things . <p> \" Your eyes are the color of chicory flowers , \" he purrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin , so white , so delicious . \" He shows me the pink tip of his tongue . Part of me wishes he would n't come . Part of me waits for him . <p> When Sam comes in , he slips out . <p> \" What are you going to do with all your money ? \" Annette asks me at supper . <p> \" I do n't know yet . \" <p> \" If you want , I could buy some stuff for you at Zeller 's with my discount . I got a new lipstick today for only 26 cents . Normally , they 're 49 . \" <p> Annette 's new lipstick is light pink , and when I try it on it looks nice . Later , when no one is looking , I slip into my mother 's room . I rub off Annette 's lipstick and put on my mother 's . It 's bright red . I study myself in the mirror for a few minutes , combing my hair one way , then another . Then I take two socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bra . I stare at the woman in the mirror . There 's a creaking noise on the stairs . I pull the socks out and wipe my mouth , feeling suddenly ashamed . <p> Friday is my last day . All day I feel restless and queer . Marie and her husband are back -- Marie comes into the store to get things : a bottle of Javex , a loaf of bread , a can of haddock . I watch her move around , bend and reach for things . A new bride . <p> Around four o'clock , he appears . I pretend not to notice him standing by the pop bottles watching me with his big eyes . <p> \" I could take you for a ride tomorrow night , \" he whispers . \" We could go up to Citadel Hill , watch the sunset . \" He opens his hand as if he is offering me something . <p> \" I do n't think so , \" I say . I have a sudden urge to tell him I 'm only fourteen and three-quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother , as if I were a prize he wanted to win . <p> \" That 's so sad , \" he says , the s 's curling out of his mouth like steam . <p> Just before closing time , Sam counts out $56 into my hand . \" Make sure you keep it somewhere safe , \" he says , winking . \" I 'll drive you home , though , just in case . \" I have never had so much money , all at once . I fold it in two and put it in my purse . <p> Outside , thick fingers of fog are rolling in from the harbor . <p> \" It 'll be thick like chowder by nine , \" Sam says . \" We 'll hear the foghorns for sure tonight . \" <p> We turn the corner onto Robie Street , and I see two sailors , each holding a woman by the hand . We stop for a light , and they cross in front of the car . One of the sailors puts his arm around the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fog surround them like tongues . I see his dark shape and the red of her dress . <p> Tomorrow , when he comes to the store , he will find me gone . He will wait by the meat case , pretending to study its contents , then buy a quart of milk , wondering if I 'm in the back room somewhere . A few days later , he will remark to Marie or Colleen , \" That other one , does n't she work here anymore ? \" \" No , \" they will say . \" She was only temporary . \" He will not ask where I live , and they will not tell him . <p> The street lights blink on suddenly , and the fog wraps itself around them , until they are muffled and dim , like secrets . Somehow I know I could have asked him for things , and he would have given them to me . <p> Illustration ( Groceries ) <p> \r\n##1002073 Waltz of the Fat Man Alvaro Rios , Alberto The Kenyon Review ; Summer 1991 ; 13 , 3 ; Research Library ## ALBERTO AL VARO RIOS WALTZ OF THE FAT MAN ices house trim was painted blue , good blue , deep and neat , with particular attention to the front door , that it should stand against spirits . He kept the house in repair , and hired a gardener in the three seasons , spring and summer , a little in autumn . In this place it was a gray wind after that , a time for planting things in the ground to save them , or to hide them . His personal appearance suffered nothing from the attentions to his house , as Noe kept on himself a trim mustache and a clean face , neat clothes for which he thanked Mrs. Martinez , patronizing her for a quarter of a century . From ironing his clothing , she knew the shape of his body more than he did , and for her consequent attention to detail in that regard he was appreciative ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving a little to the left along his right leg , the minor irregularities and embarrassments . And he was doubly thankful as she never said a word to him about it . His was a body full of slow bones , after all , and Noe moved as if long fish swam in a small place . He did not think himself fat , but he felt himself heavy , in a manner he could not explain to anyone . His body to be sure was overweight , but he did not feel it to be something of the stomach or thighs ; rather , it was a heaviness that came from the inside out , manifesting itself to the world as the body of a fat man . On his best days , Noe could make that weight look like muscles . On his best days he could make his stomach go into his chest and his shoulders , and people would believe anything he had to say . Noe had a business as a butcher , but it was too much for him , a sadness cutting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purely for social reasons . It was a civic service , and he wanted to do good things . But it was not a good choice , given what he desired , which was simply to be part of the town . To be sure , people patronized his shop , and took him up on his offer of extra services and niceties , but they did not finally stay very long to talk , not in the way they stayed for coffee and to warm themselves at the baker 's . He could see them in there , with their mouths open and their eyes rolling along a line of laughter . He could not say why the townspeople were like this , exactly . Perhaps it was his full size , or something about his looks , or about being the butcher in a ## 8 THE KENYON REVIEW town and being too good at his trade . But , the whole of his life was that no one cared much for him , or even spoke to him very much , and when he attended wakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left indentations in the kitchen linoleum , which would not go away . Noe knew that , though he tried not to be , in the people 's minds he was simply an irritation . In whatever part of the town he walked , people spoke behind their hands , and pointed when they did n't think Noe could see them . But his eyes were fat as well , and because of that he could see more . When Noe danced , he wore a blue suit , and was always alone , always at the same place outside of town , by the river reeds . He danced with the wind , which was also cruel like the women of the town , but the wind at least did not have a face . He locked the trunks of his arms with the branch arms of the black walnut trees , which also like the women of the town did not bend around to hold him , did not invite him to another , softer room . But neither could these arms of a tree leave Noe so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelly to the half-hot tongues of the weeds so that they might talk about him , and make their disapproving sounds . When he danced this dance he let out with a small noise his thin girl , which he kept inside himself . This is what had made him look fat , the holding in , the keeping in of the noise inside himself , his desire to freely speak his needs as a human being in the company of other human beings . This was his thin girl . And Noe would let her out and they would dance the dance of weddings into the night . Noe took to wearing his blue suit to the shop , because he thought he looked better . He did this in case someone would look at him , and think the better of him , think him something of a fine man after all . Then his plan of the blue suit grew into a great deal more , taking as he did the wearing of his suit as some small license . It was the license , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined to be the secret work of a regular man in the company of a regular woman . When he shook the hands of women , he did so vigorously , hoping to see movement on their bodies , some small adventure to take his breath , some nodding yes , some quiet dance of the upper body . This first adventure of a man . His was a modest plan , and worked a little . The shaking of the hands was , however , the most Noe did . It gave to him so much , and he thought the ## intimate movements of a woman to be so loud , there in front of everybody , that he could go no further . But it is why Noe attended wakes so faithfully as well , sometimes as if they were the whole of his social life : how in comforting a bereaved wife he could -- properly and in front of everyone so that there was no question of propriety -- kiss her on the cheek . Even then , after the hour of praying for the deceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time his moment was at hand , his attempt at kissing was a dizzied missing of the mark . His lips to the cheek were so clumsy and so fast that the kiss was more of something else , something not quite anything , something in keeping with his life after all . The butcher shop through the slow years began to change , as did Noe himself . He had taken up in his house the collection and caring of clocks , because , he said to himself , they had hands , and in so many clocks was a kind of heaven , a dream of sounds to make the hours pass in a manner that would allow him to open up shop again the next day . His nighttime dream became a daytime dream as well . He did not keep them , could not keep the clocks , finally , only at home . Along with Noe in his blue suit , the shop also began to find itself dressed differently , hung with clocks , first one , a plain dark wood , and then two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hands for him . There was a blue clock . Cuckoos and 28-day , anniversary clocks to the side of the scale , large-faced numbers where once there had been letters in the sections of an illustrated cow . What Noe knew and did not say was that here was the anniversary Mariquita , the schoolhouse Mariette , Marina the singular blue , Caras with her bird tongue . Armida had hands that sometimes rose outstretched to the two and ten like the blessing arms of Christ , and sometimes lowered to the five and seven of desire , one hand shorter , in the act of beckoning him , a come here , Noe . A come here , I 've got something to tell you , Noe , come on , do n't be afraid . This was no butcher shop , the townspeople would say to themselves , not with clocks . One or two clocks maybe , but not so many as this . It would not have been so bad , except that he was the only butcher in town , and people had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened as to whether or not there was perhaps a law , some ordinance , prohibiting such abuses of the known world , but no one could find any reference that applied to the walls of a butcher shop , other than cleanliness . And of that , there could be no discussion . Noe did not neglect the clocks , and therefore did not neglect the whitesheeted bed of his walls . I0 THE KENYON REVIEW One evening in winter as Noe was closing up his shop , having wound the clocks for the night and having left just enough heat in the stove that they would not suffer , he heard the blue clock falter . So much like a heartbeat had the sounds of the clocks come to be for him , that he was alarmed and stumbled in his quickness to reach the clock , though it could not move and was not falling . It called to him nonetheless as a wife in pain might call to her husband : honey , it said , please . He reached it too late , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at himself . He tried winding the clock again , thinking the unthinkable , that perhaps he had missed its turn in his haste to leave . But that was not it : the spring was taut , and there was no play . He took it down from its nail , and looked at it from different angles in his hands , but he could see nothing extraordinary . There was no obvious damage , no one had dropped it without telling him and rehung it , no insect had been boring into its side . Its blue was still blue , without blemish . He took it to the counter and measured out some butcher 's paper in which to wrap it , deciding that he would take it home to see to its difficulty . He put string around it and made a good blanket of the paper , which should comfort , he always said , what was inside . As he picked it up he could hear the workings move , and he resolved to be wary of its delicacy . He need not have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were his own mother . He put the clock in the crook of his arm , closed and locked his door , took a deep breath in the cold air , hunched his shoulders and began his walk toward home . He had errands , but they could wait . And he was , in any event , the last of the merchants to close for the evening , so he would have been out of luck anyway . Save for the clock , this was how his evenings most often came to an end , the closing of the door and the walk toward home . An occasional voice greeted him , and he returned the hello , but it was the conversation of single words , friendly enough , and that was all . Some theorized later it was the soldiers who were common in those days and who hung around with nothing better to do , that it was they who had been paid , because they never did anything for nothing , but would do anything for something , those soldiers from that kind of army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which any charges could be drawn , in much the same manner that nothing could be legally said about what Noe had done to his butcher 's shop . You get back what you give , someone was later reported as having said , someone but not anyone in particular . That 's how it was told to the captain of the police . ALBERTO ALVARO RIOS I I Noe was walking home with his package , which no one could have known was the blue clock . No one but perhaps the soldiers , and only then if they had been nosy enough to have been watching through his window , which had been recently broken and was full of cardboard patches , easy enough to hide behind . The package 's aspect was of a ham or a roast of some sort , a good rabbit , something simple and natural in the arm of a big man walking home to dinner . Darkness had set and the moon was new . He cast no shadow and made his way quickly as he left the last of the downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembling something closer to a woody mulch , and through him passed a moment of gardens from sometime in his life , gardens he had passed through , or that his mother had kept . It was a simple feeling , and brought a prickling to his skin . He next passed by the stand of walnut trees and wild oleander which was white-flowered in the summer . The oleander called to him , Noe . At first it was so quiet he said to himself he did not hear it , Noe . Noe , the oleanders said , louder this time , and he stopped to look . Though it was dark and the moon was hidden , he was not afraid . His size was such that he had never been made to be afraid , not at a moment like this . It was , if one could read his face , a curiosity , this sound which was reminiscent of his name . It was like the mulch and his mother 's garden , and it gave him a prickling of the skin once more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned to it , saying who was there , what did they want , that perhaps he could be of some service . No one answered , so he reached his free hand into the leaves and moved them around . He heard the sound and then saw what seemed like , in the dimness , a rabbit , running into the underbrush . Ha , he said , and let it go . He turned again to walk , pulling his coat back up onto his neck . Noe . It was a whisper , this time he was sure . Not a voice , but more of a breath . A half-breath , but unmistakable in its enunciation . As a child , Noe might have crossed himself , and as he was sometimes his own mother , he had the impulse , but he just stood there , once more . He put down the clock in order to enter the oleander more fully , and see what was what , but he found nothing , only branches and the small noises of startled birds and lizards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package , though he concentrated with his eyes and with his hands . It was not there . A voice whispered once more , Noe . You know me , it said , you know who I am . Noe no longer moved around . He listened , and he waited . Noe . He did know the whisper . He had in fact heard it many times . He knew the whisper more than the voice of his neighbor , whom he had seen a thousand times . I2 THE KENYON REVIEW He would not have believed any of it had this not been the blue clock . Marina his blue , who had made so many places for herself in his life . Not big places , but so many , her hair color on the trim of his house , the color of her eyes in his suit , and so on . She was the blueness inside him , the color of his appetite , the color both of what filled him and what he needed more of . Marina , he said . Noe . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noe did not answer . You can love me if you love me like a horse , said the whisper . Can you be a horse , Noe ? Can you show me how you are a horse ? Noe stood there , quietly . He stamped his foot , gingerly at first , unsure and sure at the same time . Is that it , Noe , is that all the horse you are ? Noe stamped his foot harder , and made a noise with his nose , and partway through his mouth . Yes , Noe . And are you more of a horse still ? If this were anything but his blue clock , Marina , he would have gone , and given the moment up as the ghosts of this place . Or children , or who knew what . But he could not . And then he heard the laughter of the soldiers as they could no longer contain themselves camouflaged so well otherwise in the oleanders . He heard the laughter , but did not bother with it . He turned and went home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home once before , from his family . He had to . One thing and another , right or wrong , these things did n't matter . It was simply too much to stay . He had in some manner become an exponent to a regular number . He was ordinary times ten or times twenty , always too much . And his desire carried an exponent as well . He wanted everything to be nice , to be only the Golden Rule , but times ten , and that is too much . He had no sense of himself , and yet he was everything . In that sea of mathematics he had drowned a sailor 's death . And now he had to go away again . The tide had come up , and caught him once more . He sold what was left of his business at a loss finally to Mr. Molina , who had a scarred face and who wanted to do the work . There was an art in the cutting , and it took Noe , because he was a courteous man , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molina , who had had no idea there was so much . ## And that same night Noe bought a brown horse and rode it as far into the following days and weeks , as far into the future as he could because he could not wait to see what was there . He arrived at the circus , and in it he made his life again . But he almost did not make it . A man and a sparrow ? each puts a shoulder to the wind , each to his own intention : a sparrow to fly , a man to run . Noe on this night was in between , and even with his weight he felt himself lifted , as if he were in league with angels at the edge of heaven , not quite deserving , but sneaking in with some help through a back door , hoping to go unnoticed again , as he had felt when he had come to this town . But it was not heaven , these places . He stopped because the circus people were the first to wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if this were the place , and they knew him , and they had been waiting , and what took him so long , had he not heard them calling into the night for him . But they had called him without telegraph or telephone . Something stronger . His mustache curled up from the wind and his body , which had sometimes seemed fat , was hardened , tense in that moment from the cold which had made him hold his breath and flex his muscles for the whole distance of the ride . He arrived as a beast , almost , something crazed and unshaven , out of breath . Or as a beast on top of a man , as if the horse itself was more human , and asking for help . His was a body full of slow bones still , but if it had taken his lifetime up to now to be slow , now the other foot was coming down , and it was fast . It was the other half of himself now , for the rest of his years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that moment of dust kicked up and of noise , he began his real career , this life with a whole company of half-size men , two-bodied women , and all the rest of the animals who danced . \r\n##1002156 It was a dark and stormy night . The wind howled about the lofty eaves of the stately mansion belonging to the only descendant of the fabulously wealthy banker-industrialist , the late G. B. Cashcrammer . Could we but peer into the mind of the aforementioned heiress this foul evening , we might see it in a very agitated state . The lady in question nervously paced the parqueted floor of the drawing room , stopping periodically to tilt her ashen face and to cock her delicate shell-pink ear , to listen , as it were , for some wildly anticipated sound amidst and engulfed in and under but separate somehow from the muffled drumming of the rain and the sibilance of the wind in sonorous polysyllabic tribulation . At last it came : the insistent clamor of the downstairs doorbell . She quit the drawing room , quickly gliding through a dark hallway hung with rich tapestries and draperies of deep purple , and breathlessly descending the stairs , she flung open the massive oaken door . It was he , his modest roadster parked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red feather that she loved so well . \" Hullo ! \" he called cheerily . \" Darling ! Come in , my poor darling ! \" He swept off the hunting hat , exposing a great leonine head which under ordinary circumstances would have been luxuriantly hirsutulous , but the thick wavy mane , unfortunately , now hung limp and wet about his face , spoiling his entrance . She , however , seemed not to notice in the least , but flung her creamy white arms about him and covered his wet face with kisses . The face belonged to her lover , the impossibly gifted but penniless Ernest Penn Wielder . \" Judith ! Judith ! Judith ! \" he murmured , chucking her small , stubborn ivory chin playfully and tenderly . After a longish interlude of breathless passionate kisses , they ascended the stairs arm in arm , once again traversed the dark hallway hung with tapestries of deep purple , and emerged once more into the cheery coziness of the luxuriously appointed drawing room , where a roaring fire blazed in the great marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its blue metal barrel glinting in the firelight -- a loaded rifle . They stood before the fireplace in silence , each drinking in the delicious presence of the other . Then her mood turned dark . \" Ernest , we must n't . . . we must n't break it off or do anything rash until we 've explored every avenue , \" she said ambiguously . \" Is there a viable solution ? \" he responded ironically . \" Judith , I 'm leading a life of quiet desperation without you . \" He moaned . \" Why , why , must your father have stipulated in his will that you would be cut off without a cent if we married ? \" \" Married each other , \" she corrected . \" Darling , I 've told you , he could never bear literary people . \" \" Oh ! \" he shot back angrily . \" I feel we are somehow caught in a web of good and evil ! \" \" Yes , yes , I , too , feel that paradox . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere formula . \" \" We have experienced total alienation , with no shock of recognition , no moment of truth , no catharsis , no redemption , no salvation to bring about final regeneration and peace . \" She looked at him helplessly . \" So I 'm leaving , \" he declared abruptly . \" Show me to the door ? \" \" Oh , I could n't possibly go back through that purple passage again , \" she groaned . \" No ? Then I 'll go alone . \" \" Oh , darling , please do n't leave me , \" she remonstrated pleadingly . \" Is n't there something we can do ? \" There was a caesura . He reached into the inner breast pocket of his tweed jacket and pulled out his plot wheel . He studied it , gave it a few twirls , then threw it disgustedly into the fire . \" I 'm afraid we are hopelessly trapped in a world we never made . \" \" Haunted by a house we never built . \" \" Without a room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" she repeated emphatically . \" You have found the right word and not its second cousin . \" \" Thank you . \" His inflexible jawline softened in the firelight . \" Do you remember how we met ? \" \" Darling , how could I ever forget ? That rainy day -- bumping into each other in Brentano 's -- while browsing the same bookshelf -- you with an armload of books . . . . You dropped them ? \" \" Yes , and ? \" \" ? and I helped you pick them up . Our eyes met . Do you remember ? \" \" Yes ? \" \" ? and afterwards at the little tea room next door -- we dashed over in the rain -- and spent the whole afternoon ? \" \" ? discussing ? \" \" Carl Jung ! \" she interposed . \" And indulging in gay repartee . And I found out that you lived in the middle of a writers ' block in Greenwich Village . And when the rain stopped I invited you up to my townhouse for cocktails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yes you said yes I will Yes . But then you came to your senses like the gentleman you are and vowed you would never use your poetic license to go beyond the boundaries of good taste with me ? \" \" Those are my lines , \" he interjected , suddenly angry . \" You are shifting the point of view to yourself . I wo n't let you ! \" \" I 'll shift the point of view if I bloody well want to . \" \" No , you wo n't ! \" \" Oh , really ? \" she queried . \" Watch me . \" There was a pregnant caesura . \" Well , show me , do n't tell me . Do something . Give a gesture . \" \" Why ? \" \" Because actions reveal character . \" \" Oh , you and your Aristotle and your Krapp 's English ! \" she expostulated bitterly . \" Sometimes I think Father was right ! \" At the mention of her detested forebear , he lost his head , and anger blinded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her furiously . \" Darling , we 're quarreling . Ernest , why must you do this ? \" she queried gutterally . \" Because , \" Ernest countered earnestly , \" we must earn our climax . \" She broke away . \" It 's no good , darling . You should never have thrown away your plot wheel . \" He stared at the mantle as if he had not heard her . She drew herself up to her full stature . \" It 's all over , \" she opined . \" Opined ! That does it ! \" he ejaculated , and strode to the fireplace . ( They had moved away from their former positions near the fireplace in their frantic struggle . ) He took down old Colonel Bayard Cashcrammer 's bayoneted Rebelbloodstained , dark , war-scarred firearm from its time-honored position . ( It may seem strange to the uninitiated reader that there was a rifle over the fireplace of the elegant drawing room , but that , dear reader , was the Cashcrammer way . ) \" What are you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to fire it at you , \" he reiterated patiently . Her hands flew to the white column of her throat . \" But why , why , must you fire it ? \" she pursued . \" Because , \" he rejoined hoarsely , his voice half-choking on the words , \" because it 's there . \" \r\n##1002169 From Farewell to Ogres Imbuga , Francis Literary Review ; Summer 1991 ; 34 , 4 ; Research Library ## FRANCIS IMBUGA From Farewell to Ogres Scene One ( Excerpt ) Dawn , at the shrine of the god of rain , now turned into an asylum for the mentally tired , or active ; for a small fee . Downstage centre is a grass-thatched hut . To stage right of the hut , standing on an anthill with her back turned to us , is Kadesa , priestess of the shrine . To a well-synchronized accompaniment of drums and other musical instruments , particularly the flute , Kadesa holds communion with her god in a private language . The prayer is suddenly interrupted by Mude 's entry . The drums and the flute gradually stop . There is brief silence before Kadesa turns to address the intruder .

What is this thing doing above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god of lunatics , I have not come to play games .

Mude , it is a foolish bat that thinks because it sees at night , God was thoughtless to create the light of day . Orders from above indeed . Where is above to you ? Where is above for a burrowing mole ? MUDE : It is three seasons now since the last sky-water touched the soil of our land . Dry thunder tears the sky as our crops and animals shrink from the sun 's rays . But Kadesa stands here , still praying for sky-water . When , Kadesa ? When will your god answer your prayers ? I say your god abandoned you the day you began giving shelter to lunatics at this shrine . KADESA : Christians pray for rain , Moslems pray for rain , even your fellow ogres pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these shall we blame when the rains fail ? Names . What of names ? You call us lunatics , we call you ogres . Who is to blame for these names we hurl like spears at each other ? MUDE : This was a sacred shrine once . A place of prayers and prayers alone . Your old man communed with his god and our prayers were answered . Famine was unheard of in this land . But that was before you came . ## From Farewell to Ogres ? Imbuga ## KADESA : That was before you became ogres . That was before you killed him . MUDE : That was before he died . And if I were you , I would not open old wounds . KADESA : You fear flies , is that not so ? MUDE : Flies ? What flies ? KADESA : When old wounds are opened , will flies not come for the feast ? MUDE : I do n't know what you are talking about . It seems you too are as crazy as your patients . That is why your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meant to be sacred ground , but you have now turned it into a sanctuary for lunatics and other delinquents . Creatures that talk faster than they think . Or do you deceive yourself that we do not know who visits you in the thick of night ? KADESA : Mude , pastor and messenger of ogres , your feet are indeed on sacred ground . Do not invite the wrath of my God in broad daylight . This is a shrine of life , blessed with the air of healing . I can not turn away those whom your masters have made sick . They come during the day and they come at night , but they do not come stealthily . No , they do not come secretly , as is the practice where you have come from . Save your time and mine . Tell me what your masters wish to tempt me with , this time . MUDE : Their patience is running out . My masters will no longer sit and watch as the people 's thirst threatens to snatch the ground from under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such vast natural resources to waste . You must heed their word and prepare to move peacefully to another sight . KADESA : Spittle in the sand . MUDE : What ? KADESA : Your masters ' threat is spittle in the sand . Is it the lack of rain or my patients they are worried about ? Go tell them that my patients and I will not play scapegoats in their game of hate . Go tell them that their troubles are not from the sky above . Go tell them that their troubles are not a thing that the passing wind merely picked along the way . Go tell them that they sowed their tribulations in the soil of their people and manured it with their own actions . Go remind them that a man who refuses to listen in life will not hear dirges of honor on his deathbed . ## MIDE : And who do you suppose is on his deathbed ? KADESA : That is not for me to say , I am a mere mortal . Yet I must tell you that I know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MUDE : Come Kadesa , everyone knows your roots and leaves lost their potency the day your husband died . Your husband was the medicine itself . KADESA : I can only speak , but I can not force my words into your ears . The ears of the mighty are small . That is why you and your masters have failed to answer my question : who between us defecates before our forefathers ' eyes ? I who shelter the sick and tired from their kith and kin or you who invite ogres from the north to dig up your forefathers ' graves and bare their bones ? What did he hire the strangers for ? MUDE : They are not strangers . They are helpers , friends who have come to construct a new shrine for the god of rain . They are here to lay pipes that will carry the anticipated sky water from the mountain down to the people . That is why you and your rain scouts must prepare to vacate this site before the sunset of the day after tomorrow . ( Musical instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that your masters have the power to enlist the services of their friends from up north . Only let them remember that no one here nor up north knows the skies as well as my twin scouts whom you have blindfolded and tied their hands behind their backs . Only their father before them could listen to the whispers of the wind and tell what secrets it shared with the clouds above . Only my twin scouts know the pregnancy of each and every cloud in the sky . Free their hands and eyes if it is rain you want . They are innocent . MUDE : Of course they are innocent , Kadesa . Who said your twins are guilty of anything ? The only reason they are being held is for their own protection against the wrath of the people . The people know that your twins are partly responsible for this drought . And their decision not to defend themselves over this matter is not helping them either . KADESA : So my twins are not guilty of anything , yet you want them to defend themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no contradiction . A father is not expected to apologize to his children every time he makes a slight mistake . KADESA : Four months away from here , from me and the presence of their God , and you still call it a slight mistake ? Mude , go deceive some other person . What is it you fear about my twins ? Why do you people From Farewell to Ogres ? Imbuga ## keep harassing me over this matter of sky-water knowing well that it is not the real reason for your panic ? Speak Mude , what is it you people fear about my twin scouts ? MUDE : Your twin scouts will be set free as soon as arrangements for their safety are made . We have no reason to hold them any longer if they agree to move to another sight . The people want you to move quickly so that you give the scouts from up north a chance to search the skies for water . In fact , the new scouts are said to have already spotted skywater sitting on the horned mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not split my sides with laughter ! Since when has the gift of sky-water been snatched from our creator 's goodwill ? Why this sudden impatience with our own ways ? Why these naked lies about the drought and my twin scouts ? Will you and your masters devour your own brood for temporary pleasure and satisfaction ? Because you have found new lips to pray for you ? MUDE : You can still pray for rain if you so wish . But you will have to do it somewhere else , not here . ( Musical protest . ) KADESA : You and your masters are mad . You have been bewitched . Somebody has conspired with your shadows and turned your heads into watermelons . When we get our water direct from above , we drink it and our tongues know it is water they have tasted . Now you say your masters and their friends have found alternative water from the mountain up north . Whose is it ? Do they know what abomination , what impurities they bring into their people 's water-pots ? Go tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell them to open their eyes and look in the direction of tomorrow . Tell them to open their eyes and look in the direction of our neighbors , all our neighbors . We are the only ones left , and we shall not make the same mistake . Do they want to return our lives into the hands of ogres so soon ? MUDE : I am only a messenger , Kadesa . I can not now enter my master 's head and answer your questions for him . KADESA : Go tell him to speak to the god of rain , if he has the tongue to do so . I have no more to say . Besides , it is time to save lives and not to think of death . My patients will soon be here . You better make way . ( Sudden barking of dogs . ) MUDE : That will be them . KADESA : Them ? Who ? MUDE : The new rain-scouts . Sometimes they use dogs to smell the rain . They call it technology . ( Kadesa splits the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed ! My sons should have been here to hear that . So the water which your masters want to bring to our people has a smell ? MUDE : Well , I said it is technology , and you ca n't always question these things . I say the happy end to the current drought here will justify the means . ( Bizia , one of Kadesa 's patients , rushes in excitedly . ) BIZIA : Big mother , strangers ! And what a big fool Matia is ! ( Mude retreats , finds a place and sits with his back to the audience . ) Who is he ? KADESA : Mude , a messenger from the palace . BIZIA : ( still excited ) Mude ? What a foolish name . Well , what does he want here ? This is no place for strangers . How are we expected to make rain with strangers snooping around ? KADESA : We do n't make rain Bizia , we pray for it . BIZIA : It 's no good praying to our God with such , such . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! KADESA : Bizia ! Come here . Look me in the right eye . What do you see ? BIzIA : I see me , Big mother . KADESA : Good , now watch your tongue , lest you abuse yourself . And stop trembling like a female mosquito . What kind of strangers are you fleeing from ? BIzIA : A man . A hooded man with a woman who . . . well , with a wife . KADESA : A wife ? BIZIA : I do n't know . Yes , a wife , I think . She is heavy . Very heavy , and he is ashamed of it . . . I think . And they are coming this way , led by Matia . I told you he is a fool . KADESA : And who is looking after the other patients ? BIZIA : Well , I will rush back . But I had to come and report . We must do something , Big mother . We must stop them . It is taboo , is n't it ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can we ? KADESA : Perhaps they are merely passing by . BIZIA : Merely passing by ? Big mother , I know a dangerously pregnant woman when I see one . I tell you , her time has come . Her time is here . KADESA : Then go and help them to bring her here . BIZIA : What ? Here ? From Farewell to Ogres ? Imbuga ## KADESA : Yes . She is sick . BIZIA : Sick ? Who said she is sick ? She is pregnant ! And this is Holy ground . KADESA : Go and help the others to bring her right here ! BIZIA : Me ? Now this is getting too far . KADESA : ( shouting ) I said go and help the others to bring her over ! ( They stare at each other briefly . Bizia turns and exits . Mude turns and speaks to Kadesa . ) MUDE : The young man was right you know . This is sacred ground . KADESA : Sacred ground , yes .

She silently wept away her grief . This was the second time in her short married life she had shaken hands with grief . So why must she not weep ? The first time had been two years ago . At that time , she had a very beautiful girl of about three , her firstborn . It was at that time that she had started her career as a teacher for the Catholic mission . Then , they had been living with her parents in the same town ( or , more correctly , village ) . The missionaries used to give them gifts on every public Christian feast day . The gifts took the form of bales of clothes or , sometimes , loads of other very basic amenities . Anytime she got these gifts Aunty would dole them out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , two years ago , she had received some Easter gifts of clothes and several cartons of tinned butter oil . As she usually did , she shared them out to all and sundry . One of her uncles came a bit too late . As a result he missed getting any \" supply . \" He then went up to her and , in the hearing of several others , proclaimed , \" So , woman , you counted me out of your precious bounty , eh ? \" Aunty could n't believe that she had failed to give this man some of the gifts . But before she could make an answer , or even try to make amends , he went on , \" As if I should n't eat butter oil ! Anyway , I want no more of it . But be sure that you shall pay for this insult . My wrath , once awoken , can not be easily cooled ! \" As if he were the Almighty himself ! He then strutted to his house . One of the women present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a great king of darkness ? greatly feared for Aunty , but when she voiced this , Aunty made light of it . Two days elapsed after this episode . Suddenly , on the night of the third , Yema , Aunty 's three-year-old , took to bed with a high fever . All attempts at herbal curation only ended in bringing the child back lower than square one . Upon this Aunty took her to the nearest clinical post , Sumbuya , about ten miles away . Her feet had barely touched the hospital threshold when the child fell into a coma , sweating profusely . The nurse in charge immediately administered an injection , but the drug flowed out as soon as the needle was withdrawn ; nothing would make the drug stay in Yema 's body . The nurse then had to resort to tablets and syrups , all of which the patient threw up instantly . Failing all attempts at even initial medication , the hospital staff found it pointless to admit their new ## patient . Thus Aunty had to go back . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . And since she could catch no vehicle , a kindly priest going that way offered her a ride back . About two miles from their destination a loud clanging of bells was heard and a great shadow hovered over the vehicle . With the sound of mighty wings flapping , the shadow disappeared and , simultaneously , the car 's engine went dead , violently throwing the vehicle into sinister darkness . A shudder went down Aunty 's spine as a sound between a gasp and a sigh escaped the child . The priest strangled a curse , murmuring in its stead a prayer , to which Aunty replied \" Amen . \" Torch in hand , the priest examined the engine and , finding nothing amiss , tried to restart it . But it coughed , sputtered and died out again . No amount of coaxing could bring it to life . Another shiver went through Aunty 's frame and the priest 's face was bathed in cold sweat . He cursed violently and asked Aunty to accompany him in singing a canticle . In their song they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muster , while Aunty interspersed them with saints of her own making , such as Mbavai , Kokatoa ( her great forefathers ) and several others , for , she said , it was not only Europe that could brew saints . Once again the priest kicked the starter and this time , it came true . The lights shone brightly . As they resumed their journey strange nocturnal catcalls and whistles rent their vigil . As they neared the village the strange shadow resumed its hovering . Letting the engine run under remote control , the priest wanted to see the creator of the shadow . So he stepped out lightly . But it vanished again . This time the engine gave a low-pitched whine , spurted thrice , but before it could fall silent , the priest struck a benediction . The engine responded loudly and clearly . When she reached home , Aunty sat in grave meditation , interrupted only by a chuckle from the child . A heavy wind blew , and a rustle of twigs was heard overhead , followed by a loud bellow and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and convulsions seized her . At about an hour to dawn a faint hooting of owls was heard . Soon a flock of these heralds of darkness alighted upon Aunty 's roof . Instantaneously her uncle 's threat flashed through her mind and she rushed to his house . With a loud moaning she woke him up , \" Oh Uncle . . . \" she started sobbing . As if he had been expecting her , he answered drowsily . \" It is now already too late to do anything . The child 's fate was decided yesterday . I am sorry to say I can not help in any way now . \" His voice had a mocking edge to it . Oh vile witchery ! Envy it is ! What uncle that will not forgive his niece 's misconduct ? Oh woeful day ! \" Name your price , uncle . But spare my child , my firstborn child , \" she wailed . \" Oh Aunty . . . oh-oo-oo-oo ! \" The fearful shriek from Gaardie , Aunty 's ward , pierced her heart like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake ? George ## home and was just in time to perceive the last breath leave Yema ' s nostrils . The child let her head roll , no longer of this world . An intensive calm then befell the entire village . Rain clouds immediately blurred the horizon . But the drops would not fall . They held in their place as if regarding the macabre spectacle vilely sacred . Suddenly , as if upon a cue , the whole village burst forth in lamentation . The funeral dirges of all sorts were uttered in a thunderous heart-melting outcry . Everyone , from the oldest grandsire to the littlest child , wailed . Some cried from a feeling of genuine sympathy , some in mockery , and some from wicked ghoulish satisfaction . Oh Yema , pride of Tisa 's soul and apple of Aunty 's doting eye ... oh thou art turned corpse today . Fare thee well . If ever a mortal played a hand in thy demise leave him to the Great Avenger , the Almighty . Trouble not his sleep nor haunt any of his activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place for me for , lo , I am in thy wake . Large flocks of various nocturnal birds of prey joined the hooting owls , all making music in their various tongues , bidding adieu to the departed soul . An old woman commented to Aunty that the presence of these winged mourners boded no good . Therefore , she thought it wise for Aunty to leave this town immediately , even if for only a few days . Aunty might have rejected this piece of advice , but she had now had warnings once too often . In fact , some two hours after the burial , Aunty 's young baby boy started shrieking violently and crying much as if he were beholding some strange sight . His temperature rose suddenly . Aunty realized that her enemy , whoever that was , had just begun his vile job of murdering her innocents . She , therefore , prevailed upon Tisa to gather their few belongings , and they fled the town in the priest 's car . The nocturnal birds escorted them to the accompaniment of hoots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four miles distance . That was what drove them from her home , and a home indeed ! Quaint it was , was n't it ? Recollections of this particular episode had always plunged Aunty into a morose mood . Tisa 's arrest had come as the second major unhappy occurrence in her otherwise serene life . Why , therefore , must she not weep ? \r\n##1002172 The Search for the Gold Finger Okafor , Chinyere Literary Review ; Summer 1991 ; 34 , 4 ; Research Library ## CH1NYERE OKAFOR The Search for Gold Finger OKEKE , OKAFOR , OBAZE , OSAZUwA , all were lined up in the presence of Chief Igbinovia , the security agent . \" Doctor Okeke , sit down , \" ordered the Chief . \" Which of you took Dr. Okeke 's ring ? \" he quickly added . None of the suspects moved or said anything . The chief sat down , brought out a file from the drawer , opened it and started writing . Actually , he was not using the file . He was pretending to be busy by sketching one of the faces in front of him . Okafor started squeezing his fingers and balancing his weight on each leg in turn . Osazuwa and Obaze were immobile with their eyes focused straight ahead . Suddenly the chief looked up , and shouted : \" You ! You ! ! You look like a thief ! ! ! \" \" I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not say that you are a thief . I said that you look like one . See , see ! Your eyes are too sharp , like the eyes of a seasoned pickpocket ! ! \" \" I am not a pickpocket . I no be small boy . I don old , \" defended Okafor , a man of about twenty-five years who looked considerably older . To augment his defence , he added , \" I get wife . I am married with children so my eye don old , no be small pickin im eye . \" The way this illogical argument was delivered in a mixture of pidgin and standard English could have evoked laughter in a less serious situation , especially as the young old-man ended his speech by balancing his body on his two legs for the first time since he entered the room , as if to dare anybody to challenge the logicality of his point that was not clear . The chief resumed his paperwork . After a while , the chief resumed his intimidation tactics . \" You ! \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . \" You ! You are given an honest job by the government ! ! You betray the trust by stealing ! ! ! If somebody is working in your Mamma 's house and you lose your finger , will you give that person a job again ? \" He did not give anybody a chance to comment before he quickly added , \" That is how you betray the trust . \" As he stood up , he said , \" I do not have more time to waste on you . If you have swallowed it , the X-ray will show it ! Full stop ! ! \" It was Osazuwa who spoke up this time : \" As I never shit today , I think the X-ray fit show everything . Me I never eat since morning . I never steal for my life . My Christmas salary . . . I fit sacrifice am . \" \" Wetin you go do with your Christmas salary ? \" asked the chief scornfully . \" My money . Mmh . I be Bini man - o . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the sentence but squeezed his face in such a way that the big scars on his face assumed different shapes , his mouth curved downwards towards the chin and his eyes buldged , especially when he prolonged the word \" go \" for emphasis . \" I ## be bini man - o , \" he stressed before continuing . \" I go use my salary find the head of this finger , a be na ring . I go do am . \" \" You go consult juju eh ? \" asked the chief scornfully . \" I go find di person who hold the finger , a bi na ring . Me , I go find am . \" From his quiet corner , Dr. Okeke said , \" When you find out , all I want is my ring . My college ring . I left the rank and glamour of my position in the army to study and wear that ring . Now somebody is going to sell it for chicken ten naira or so . \" \" Which of you came out last from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to extricate himself from guilt . \" We were not working in Dr. Okeke 's office , Osazuwa and me . It was only Obaze who was working there . \" \" So you did not enter the room ? \" \" We entered , \" replied Okafor , \" but it was only to assess the faulty air conditioner . \" \" Dr. Okeke was with us that time . \" He added facing Dr. Okeke , whom he asked , \" Oga , you entered your office with us and Obaze was there when we left . \" \" I leave una - o . I go wash my hand - o . I be strong Christian - o , \" shouted Obaze . \" Shut-up ! All the atrocities in this country are committed by Christians and Muslims . A pagan has never ruled this country , \" declared the chief who quickly queried Obaze , \" How you go wash your hand when you never finish work ? \" \" I just dey wash like that . \" \" Like wetin ? \" asked the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , so I just dey wash small small as I dey work . \" The chief was begining to get the hang of it all . If the two , Okafor and Osazuwa entered together with the doctor , assessed something and left , then the one who stayed longest had the best opportunity of finding and taking the ring . However , it would not take a thief who knew his onions much time to pinch a golden ring from a reading table . The chief then decided to change tactics . \" Dr. Okeke , how much does that ring cost ? \" \" I bought it for one hundred and twenty dollars in 1971 . It is not just the monetary value of the ring that is important . The emotional value is even more important plus the fact that even if you give me the money , you can never find that ring to buy . So , what I want is my ring and that is that , period ... That ring has become part of me . Anybody who sees me knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my body . So , you must find it o - o . \" Though delivered harshly , Dr. Okeke 's appeal was very touching . The Chief allowed everybody to take in the implications of that plea before he spoke . \" A law book I bought for one pound ten shillings in 1970 now cost one hundred and ten naira , that is about e -eh ... thirty five times what it cost me in 1970 . And now if you calculate the present cost of a ring that used to cost up to one hundred and twenty dollars , we 'll be talking in thousands . I do n't know the present rate of the dollar to naira . \" This analysis has revealed two facts to the culprits . One , that the chief also studied law and therefore had friends who were lawyers and magistrates and therefore he could deal with them . Two , The Search for the Gold Finger ? Okafor ## the amount of money involved was tremendous . Okafor was swinging his head from side to side at the realization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that he could never even think of the great amount involved in the ring let alone pay for it , if they were levied . Osazuwa 's eyes were focussed on his folded arms as if he was deep in thought . The Chief 's harsh voice alerted everyone and drew the attention of every ear and eye . \" What I want to do now is to have the three of you thoroughly beaten up . Then you will tell the truth . After that I 'll send you to Okhoro where you 'll spend the Christmas with the Police and probably spend that your salary . \" He pressed the bell promptly and a security man entered . \" Take these men to the . . . \" He did not finish the sentence before Obaze cut in , trembling at the prospect of receiving the police treatment he had heard about so much and dreaded like poison . \" Sir , maybe . . . maybe Oga go let us go for im office again go search for the ring again . I never go cell since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyes focussed on Dr. Okeke , who appeared to be the only one then to save the suspects from the much dreaded Okhoro Police Cell . He pitied them , especially the innocent ones , but he also wanted his ring and he was sure they ransacked every nook and corner of that Office while searching for the ring . It would be a miracle for that ring to materialise in that office and Dr. Okeke did not believe in miracles . Back in the office , Dr. Okeke just sat in the ante-office usually occupied by his secretary . \" Og , come inside now . \" \" Why am I coming in ? Go and search . When you finish , we go to Okhro police . \" Okafor , Obaze and Osazuwa trooped in followed by the security officer . After some time , Dr. Okeke went in to see what was happening . \" Have n't you finished yet ? Let 's go to Okhoro , \" he ordered them , even though he had no intention of going anywhere else for he was very tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" exclaimed Osazuwa squinting his eyes , bending his waist , and straining his neck like a chicken suffering from jaundice . \" Wetin my eye dey see so ? \" he asked . Without waiting or expecting a reply , he used his right hand to shade his eye even though it was not sunny in the room . All eyes were then on him observing his monkey antics . \" Something de shine for yonder . See wetin e be dey shine so . \" It was Obaze , standing near the book shelf , who turned and picked up the ring which was lying beside the ink pot on top of the shelf . \" Is this your ring , Sir ? \" \" Yes ! My ring . It is . Glory be to God , \" shouted Dr. Okeke , who did not believe in miracles . Obaze , the Christian , knelt down , raised his hands and shouted , \" Osalobua . \" Mr. Okafor demanded , \" Who was it that was searching that shelf just now ? \" "], "labels": [0, 0, 1, 1]}}; }
